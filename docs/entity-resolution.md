# Taxonomy entity resolution

Extraction returns free-text categories, subcategories and topics. Without
resolution every spelling ("bug bash testing", "Bug bash testing", "bug bash
testing session") becomes its own graph node and its own point in the
`entities` vector collection, and the knowledge-graph tools then show three
entities for one concept. The resolver in
`backend/python/app/modules/entity_resolution/` maps each extracted name to one
canonical, per-org node before anything is written.

## Where it runs

Indexing, between classification and every write that consumes the names:

```text
classify -> resolve_entities -> record summary -> blob -> enrich (graph + entity points)
```

Both the service path (`app/events/events.py`) and the legacy pipeline
(`app/modules/transformers/pipeline.py`) call
`SinkOrchestrator.resolve_entities(ctx)`. The resolver mutates
`record.semantic_metadata` to canonical names and attaches an
`EntityResolution` to the transform context; `GraphDBTransformer` reads it to
pick the nodes.

## The three tiers

1. **Exact match.** Names are normalized (NFKC, casefold, collapsed whitespace,
   surrounding quotes and trailing punctuation stripped) and looked up in one
   indexed query per collection against `normalizedName` and
   `normalizedAliases`, so a spelling that was merged once resolves exactly
   from then on, with no vector query and no model call.
2. **Winner lookup.** Every miss gets its single nearest existing entity of the
   same org, entity type and subcategory level, from a hybrid dense + BM25
   search on the `entities` collection. There is no score threshold. Winners
   are then checked against the graph in one batched call per kind: a point
   whose node was deleted, belongs to another org, or is a legacy global node
   (no `normalizedName`) is not offered (`stale_winner`).
3. **Merge decision.** One structured model call per record (role `indexing`,
   low reasoning effort) answers, pair by pair, whether a name is the same
   concept as its winner, the same concept as another name in the record, or
   new. Every answer is validated: a target must be the offered winner, an
   in-record pointer must be of the same kind, anything else becomes new. A
   cleaned display form for a new name (`canonical_name`) is kept only when it
   differs from the extracted name in case, whitespace or punctuation alone
   (`normalizer.spelling_key`); one that adds or drops words is ignored
   (`rejected_canonical`), since it would otherwise merge into an existing node
   the model was never offered. Combining marks, digits and symbols count as
   spelling ("दिन" is not "दीन", "C++" is not "C#"), and so does punctuation
   inside a number or at the start of a name, including after an opening
   bracket or quote ("3.11" is not "311", ".NET" and "(.NET)" are not "NET").

Languages go through a static ISO table and skip tiers 2 and 3. Departments
keep their exact match against the org's department list. Record and
record-group entities are identities and are never merged.

## What gets written

- Canonical nodes carry `name` (first spelling wins, never renamed),
  `normalizedName`, `orgId`, `aliases` with their `normalizedAliases`
  (capped at 20) and a deterministic
  `_key` derived from `(orgId, collection, normalizedName)`, so two records
  that create the same name concurrently converge on one node. New nodes and
  new aliases are written before the record's graph transaction opens: both
  writes are idempotent, and inside two open ArangoDB stream transactions two
  inserts of the same key conflict and fail one record's enrichment.
- Every `belongsTo*` edge the resolver writes carries `extractedName`, the raw
  string the model produced for that record. A wrong merge can be undone per
  record from it. Edges copied onto a deduplicated record by
  `copy_document_relationships` carry only `createdAtTimestamp`.
- The entity vector point for a node keeps its id and is embedded from the
  canonical name only, so the vector never drifts as merges accumulate.
  Aliases are payload only: shown to the merge model and in
  `search_entities` results, never embedded. A point is rewritten only when
  its payload or membership changed.

Aliases are written only to a node of the writing org: a legacy node (no
`orgId`) or another org's node is left unchanged, so one tenant's spellings
never reach another's entity search. A deduplicated record is projected
from the nodes its copied edges reach. Its own org's nodes keep their
aliases, nodes without an org (legacy, or global departments) are projected
without aliases, and another org's node is skipped.

Subcategories only resolve within their own level, and per-org nodes never
link across orgs. Legacy global nodes created before the feature are not
migrated; a reindex moves a record onto canonical nodes.

## Entity index rebuild

The `entities` collection is a projection of the graph. The indexing service
rebuilds it in the background (`app/modules/indexing/entity_index_rebuild.py`),
without extraction or model calls other than embedding:

- **Per connector** (app document): its record groups, then its indexed,
  non-deleted, named records, written as on the index path.
- **Per org** (org document): its canonical taxonomy nodes and its
  departments (including global ones). Membership is read from the graph and
  replaces the stored one; a node no record reaches has its point deleted.
- **Sweep, per org every 24 hours:** the org's taxonomy, department and
  record-group points are checked against the graph in batches. A point is
  deleted when its node is gone or belongs to another org. Points of legacy
  nodes without an org are kept, because records still link to them. Record
  points are not swept; single-record delete removes them.

A document is done when its `entityIndexState` equals
`v<ENTITY_INDEX_VERSION>:<provider>:<model>:<dimension>`, so changing the
embedding model re-runs every pass. Each point also records the model that
embedded it (`metadata.embeddingModel`). A write re-embeds a point from
another model, or one written before this field existed, even when its text
is unchanged. Indexing therefore repairs whatever a pass missed. The first
rebuild after an upgrade re-embeds every entity point once.

When the dimension differs, the indexing service drops and recreates the
collection on start, and the passes refill it. Until it does, the query and
connector services fail entity calls with the mismatch, retrying
initialisation every 30 seconds. Points of legacy nodes without an org are
not projected, so after a recreate they return only when their records are
reindexed.

The rebuild runs on one indexing replica at a time (Redis leader
`entity_index_rebuild:leader`), one page per tick. It resumes from the cursor
on the document after a restart. The cursor is valid only for the marker in
`entityIndexTarget`; under a new marker the pass starts over.

- A pass with write failures is retried from the start twice.
- After that, the document is marked done with `entityIndexExhausted: true`
  and its failure count kept.
- A document whose pages raise on 10 consecutive ticks is also given up, so
  it cannot hold the loop.
- A sweep that fails 3 times waits for the next interval. On the Redis vector
  backend, a sweep cannot page past 10,000 points of one org and stops there.

Progress is logged under `entity_index_rebuild:` with the app or org key,
phase and cursor.

## Modes

Resolution is always on: the indexing container builds the resolver in
`APPLY` mode and there is no feature flag. `ResolutionMode.SHADOW` (compute and
log every decision, write nothing) and `ResolutionMode.OFF` exist as
constructor options for tests and for anyone wiring the resolver by hand.
Shadow decisions are logged as `entity_resolution shadow ... decisions=[...]`.

## Failure policy

| Failure | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Vector store unavailable | Names become new nodes; `vector_error` fallback counter |
| Model unavailable or malformed | Every name in that call becomes new; `model_error` counter; the cached model is rebuilt from config for the next record |
| Model call slower than 60 s | Same as unavailable. The bound applies to each provider call (and each reflection retry), not to the wait for the shared indexing model slot, which is backpressure |
| Model returns an id it was not offered | That name becomes new; `rejected_target` counter |
| Winner check against the graph fails | No winner offered for that kind; `winner_check_error` counter |
| Graph lookup fails | Apply mode: enrichment fails as today, no point is written. Shadow mode: logged |

Metrics live in `app/telemetry/modules/entity_resolution_metrics.py`:
names by outcome, model calls by result, fallbacks by reason and per-record
latency. Each record also logs one `entity_resolution mode=... tier0_hits=...`
line.

## Operational notes

- The `entities` vector collection has a `metadata.level` payload index. The
  store ensures its payload indexes on every start (index creation is
  idempotent on every backend), so an existing collection picks it up too.
- The graph indexes on `(orgId, normalizedName)` and, on Arango,
  `(orgId, normalizedAliases[*])` are created by the providers' index setup
  on startup for `categories`, `subcategories1..3`, `topics` and
  `languages`. On Neo4j each stored alias is also a
  `(:TaxonomyAlias {orgId, collection, normalized})-[:ALIAS_OF]->(node)`
  node under a composite uniqueness constraint, since a list property cannot
  be index-seeked; alias matches seek those instead of scanning the org's
  nodes of a label.
