"""py-spy profiling of the services under load.

Profiling perturbs what it measures, so it never runs during the measured
window. The runner profiles a dedicated extra iteration instead, and the
throughput/latency numbers in the report always come from unprofiled runs.

Beyond the flame graph, the ordered sample stream gives something a flame graph
cannot: the longest stretch the interpreter spent in one frame without moving.
On a single-loop service that stretch *is* the stall, and it names the function
responsible — which is what an event-loop-lag counter would only hint at.
