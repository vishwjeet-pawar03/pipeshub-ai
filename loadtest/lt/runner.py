"""Run orchestration.

One run = warmup iterations (discarded) + `repeat` measured iterations +
optionally one profiled iteration. Each iteration is:

    seed corpus -> create connectors -> start collectors -> trigger sync
    -> poll to completion -> stop collectors -> tear connectors down

Seeding happens once per run, not per iteration: the corpus is deterministic,
so re-uploading it between iterations would only add wall-clock and a fresh
chance for the object store to behave differently.
