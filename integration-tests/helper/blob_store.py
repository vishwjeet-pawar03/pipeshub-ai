"""Ask blob storage whether a record's bytes are really gone.

The obvious check — call the document API and expect a 404 — cannot answer this
question. The API resolves a document through its MongoDB metadata, so once
that metadata is deleted the API returns 404 whether the bytes were removed or
merely orphaned. Those two outcomes are indistinguishable from outside and only
one of them is correct, so this module goes to the storage backend itself.

Which backend that is depends on how the instance was installed, so the probe
dispatches on the ``storageVendor`` recorded against each document rather than
assuming one. A vendor it cannot inspect raises instead of returning "clean" —
a cleanup probe that quietly passes when it cannot see anything is worse than
no probe at all, because it converts an unknown into a green tick.
