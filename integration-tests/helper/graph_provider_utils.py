Graph Provider Utilities

Shared utility functions for graph provider testing (polling, waiting, etc.).
These functions are provider-agnostic and work with any GraphProviderProtocol implementation.

    Wait for sync to complete by polling connector status until IDLE, then read record count.

    1. Poll connector.status until it becomes IDLE (not SYNCING/FULL_SYNCING).
    2. Query graph record count once (sync is awaited before IDLE; no extra settle wait).
    3. Optionally assert min_records threshold.

    Args:
        pipeshub_client: Client for accessing connector API
        graph_provider: Graph provider for querying records
        connector_id: Connector ID to monitor
        timeout: Maximum seconds to wait for completion (default 300)
        poll_interval: Seconds between status polls (default 5)
        min_records: Minimum record count threshold (optional)

    Returns:
        Record count after connector reports IDLE

    Raises:
        TimeoutError: If sync doesn't complete within timeout
        AssertionError: If min_records threshold not met
