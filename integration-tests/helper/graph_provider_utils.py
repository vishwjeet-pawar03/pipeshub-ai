Shared utility functions for graph provider testing (polling, waiting, etc.).

    Wait for sync to complete by polling connector status until IDLE, then read record count.

    Uses a two-phase approach to avoid a race where the first poll sees the
    pre-sync IDLE state before the backend has transitioned to SYNCING/FULL_SYNCING:

    1. **Phase 1** — wait up to *sync_start_timeout* seconds for status to leave IDLE.
       If it never leaves, assume the sync was fast enough to complete between the
       enable call and the first poll.
    2. **Phase 2** — wait for status to return to IDLE (the real post-sync IDLE).
    3. Query graph record count and optionally assert *min_records*.

    Args:
        pipeshub_client: Client for accessing connector API
        graph_provider: Graph provider for querying records
        connector_id: Connector ID to monitor
        timeout: Maximum seconds to wait for completion (default 300)
        poll_interval: Seconds between status polls (default 5)
        min_records: Minimum record count threshold (optional)
        sync_start_timeout: Max seconds to wait for sync to start (default 30)

    Returns:
        Record count after connector reports IDLE

    Raises:
        TimeoutError: If sync doesn't complete within timeout
        AssertionError: If min_records threshold not met

    A full sync is required for scope *narrowing* to be reflected: it strips

    entities that left the filter drop out of BELONGS_TO-guarded counts.

    Changing the filter sets the backend ``pendingFullSync`` flag, so the re-enable that
    ``update_connector_filters_sync_safe`` performs is itself a full sync — no separate
    ``resync`` is needed (that would just run a redundant second full sync).

    ``filters`` must already carry the ``sync.values`` nesting the connector reads
    (see ``load_connector_filters``); the filters-sync endpoint stores the payload
    verbatim, so a flat dict is written to the wrong path and silently ignored.
