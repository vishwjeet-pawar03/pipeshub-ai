"""Ask MongoDB what it still holds.

MongoDB does not store records — those live in the graph. What it stores is the
*storage document*: the metadata describing where a record's bytes live, its
version history, and its soft-delete flag. That makes it the store where two of
the scenarios on the test list are actually answerable:

* "MongoDB document collection — record and metadata storage document deleted"
* "Must be marked for soft delete, then cleaned via the scheduled job"

The second one is why ``is_soft_deleted`` exists separately from
``document_exists``. Soft deletion and hard deletion look identical from the
graph's side and are completely different in MongoDB, and confusing the two is
how a record that was only ever flagged gets reported as cleaned up.
