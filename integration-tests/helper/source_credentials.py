"""Whether a missing connector credential is a skip or a failure.

A connector suite whose credential is absent skips itself. On a developer's
machine that is right: nobody has every account. On the nightly run it hides
the thing we most want to know, because a rotated or expired secret looks
exactly like a passing run — the suite reports success having tested nothing.

So the run says which it is. ``PIPESHUB_REQUIRE_CONNECTOR_SECRETS=1`` (set by
the workflow for the nightly and for a run that deliberately picked one
connector) turns these into failures; everywhere else they stay skips.
