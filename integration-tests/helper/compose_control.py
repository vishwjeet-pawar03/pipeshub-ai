"""Restart, stop and poke the services of the running integration stack.

The resilience tests break a dependency on purpose while the product is busy,
so they need the same ``docker compose`` handle the workflow used to start the
stack. By default that is the integration compose file for the graph backend
under test, run from its own directory, which is what the workflow does:

    RESILIENCE_COMPOSE_FILE     compose file (default: the integration file for
                                TEST_GRAPH_DB_TYPE under deployment/docker-compose)
    RESILIENCE_COMPOSE_PROJECT  compose project name, when the stack was started
                                with ``-p`` (default: compose's own, the file's folder)

Anything that stops the handle from working (no docker CLI, no daemon, a
different stack, the service not running) is a :class:`ComposeUnavailable`
with the reason, which the tests turn into a skip.
