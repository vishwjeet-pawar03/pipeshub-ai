"""Ask the vector database what it still holds.

Deletion has to clear four stores — graph, vector, blob and MongoDB — and until
now only the graph was ever checked. A delete that clears the graph and orphans
every embedding passes the existing suite.

Two things about the payload shape drive this module's API, both confirmed
against a running instance rather than read off the write path:

* Points carry no record id. The only record-ish key is
  ``metadata.virtualRecordId``, the id a record keeps across updates that do
  not change its content — the graph explicitly carries it forward so that
  points keyed by it are not orphaned. Blob paths and storage documents are
  filed under the same id, which is what lets one lookup answer for three
  stores, so the counting helpers below are keyed on it.
* ``connectorIds`` is a top-level array, so connector-wide deletion is
  answerable directly.

Every count scans *all* collections rather than the one the product would have
written to. A cleanup bug that leaves points behind in an unexpected collection
is exactly the failure worth catching, and asking the product where it thinks
the points are would hide it.
