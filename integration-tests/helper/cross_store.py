"""Check a deletion cleared every store, not just the graph.

Deleting a record has to clear four places: the graph, the vector database,
blob storage and MongoDB. Each is checked by its own probe; this module ties
them together and handles the one thing that is easy to get wrong when writing
such a test.

**Capture the footprint before deleting.** The identifiers the other three
stores are keyed on — chiefly the virtual record id — are only obtainable from
the graph, and the delete removes them. A test that tries to look them up
afterwards finds nothing and then "passes", having checked that nothing is
nothing. ``capture_footprint`` exists to make the ordering explicit, and the
assertions take a footprint rather than a record name so that a test cannot be
written the wrong way round by accident.

Blob storage and MongoDB both key a record's files on
``{orgId}/PipesHub/records/{virtualRecordId}``, so one footprint answers for
both.
