"""The @pipeshub-ai/mcp package, run against a real PipesHub.

Every other test of this package runs it in isolation against fixed example
data. This is the only place the package and a real server are asked whether
they still understand each other, which is the one thing a release actually
depends on.

Nothing here imports from the package. It is run as a separate process, over
the command line, holding a token minted the way a real MCP host mints one --
because that is how a customer runs it, and anything closer would be testing a
different thing.
