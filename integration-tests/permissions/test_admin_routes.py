"""Admin-only routes refuse a signed-in member and let the admin through.

Every other suite calls these routes as the org admin, so a route that lost its
admin check would pass them all while any member could change the org's
sign-in settings, AI models or service tokens. Here each route in
``helper/admin_route_table.py`` is called twice:

* as a throwaway member, who must be refused with the product's own answer:
  400 "Admin access required" from Node's ``userAdminCheck``, or 403 from the
  Python services (passed through by the gateway);
* as the admin, who must get past the check. The admin request is shaped so
  that whatever comes after the check (a validator, a lookup of an id that does
  not exist) stops it before anything is written.

``unit/test_admin_route_inventory.py`` keeps the table in step with the source,
so a new admin route cannot skip this suite.
