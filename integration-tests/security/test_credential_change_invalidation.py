"""Changing a credential should end the sessions that credential opened.

Two events are expected to end an existing session: changing the account's
password, and blocking the account. The first works. The second does not.

The mechanism is in ``auth.middleware.ts``. On every request it loads the most
recent ``UserActivities`` row whose type is in ``SESSION_INVALIDATING_ACTIVITIES``
— currently LOGOUT, PASSWORD_CHANGED and ROLE_CHANGED — and rejects the token if
that activity is newer than the token's ``iat``. It also rejects a token whose
user is flagged ``isDeleted``.

Blocking writes no such activity, and ``isBlocked`` is not among the fields the
middleware checks. So a blocked account's existing sessions keep working until
the token expires, which is 24 hours.
