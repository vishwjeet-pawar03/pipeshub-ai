"""Changing a credential should end the sessions that credential opened.

Two events are expected to end an existing session: changing the account's
password, and the account being blocked. Both do, and these tests keep it so.

The mechanism is in ``auth.middleware.ts``. On every request it loads the most
recent ``UserActivities`` row whose type is in ``SESSION_INVALIDATING_ACTIVITIES``
— LOGOUT, PASSWORD_CHANGED, ROLE_CHANGED and ACCOUNT_BLOCKED — and rejects the
token if that activity is newer than the token's ``iat``. It also rejects a token
whose user is flagged ``isDeleted``. Five wrong passwords lock the account and
record ACCOUNT_BLOCKED, so a session opened before the lockout ends with it.
