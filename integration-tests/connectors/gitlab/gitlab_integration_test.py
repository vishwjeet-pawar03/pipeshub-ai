GitLab Connector – Integration Tests (pre-provisioned, read-only + self-cleaning mutations)
===========================================================================================

Scope comes from ``GITLAB_TEST_GROUP`` + the two project env vars; fixture *shapes*
are discovered by the conftest rather than pinned, so a re-provisioned fixture needs
no code change. Only the two frozen blocks snapshots and the pinned merge request are
addressed by number.

Every CI leg, every PR and the nightly cron share ONE GitLab group, and different PRs
run at the same time. The primary project is therefore never written to: the six
mutation and filter cases (orders 20-25) each create a throw-away connector scoped to
the *mutation* project and assert by external id, so nothing another run does can
reach an assertion here. Code mutations are further confined to ``it/<run_id>/`` —
the connector only syncs the default branch, so concurrent runs share it and only a
path namespace keeps them apart.

  order 1  TC-SYNC-001            — full sync baseline + graph self-consistency
  order 2  TC-GL-RG-001           — the five-way project record-group shape
  order 3  TC-GL-RG-002           — namespace group nodes are flat, and each gets an App edge
  order 4  TC-GL-USER-001         — AppUsers keyed by GitLab numeric id + USER_APP edge
  order 5  TC-GL-USER-002         — pseudo-groups stand in for members with no public_email
  order 6  TC-GL-ISSUE-001        — TICKET properties, and the people fields that are absent
  order 7  TC-GL-ISSUE-002        — issue_type mapping and the raw GitLab state
  order 8  TC-GL-ISSUE-BLOCKS-001 — streamed issue blocks snapshot
  order 9  TC-GL-ATTACH-001       — description-upload FileRecords on an issue and an MR
  order 10 TC-GL-ATTACH-002       — both attachments reach COMPLETED
  order 11 TC-GL-MR-001           — merged MR PULL_REQUEST properties
  order 12 TC-GL-MR-BLOCKS-001    — streamed MR blocks snapshot
  order 13 TC-GL-CODE-001         — CodeFileRecord properties incl. extension-less blob
  order 14 TC-GL-CODE-002         — folder records, PARENT_CHILD chain, dotfile exclusion
  order 15 TC-GL-CODE-TS-001      — blob source timestamps arrive from the backfill
  order 16 TC-GL-PERM-001         — the ACL split across the five record groups
  order 17 TC-GL-PERM-002         — permission type is always OWNER; one-hop resolution
  order 18 TC-GL-CKPT-001         — sync points for the three per-project data groups
  order 19 TC-GL-IDX-001          — indexing reaches a terminal state
  order 20 TC-INCR-ISSUE-001      — issue create then update: version += 1, new revision
  order 21 TC-GL-CONF-001         — confidential issue: own ACL group, exception grants, group swap
  order 22 TC-INCR-MR-001         — MR update-only: no new record, version += 1
  order 23 TC-INCR-CODE-001       — new/update/rename/move/delete in one commit set
  order 24 TC-FILTER-001          — a group filter beside the selected repository widens nothing
  order 25 TC-FILTER-002          — Index Code Files off: records exist, AUTO_INDEX_OFF
  order 26 TC-GL-FILTEROPT-001    — the group and project pickers behind the sync filters
  order 27 TC-GL-ONEREPO-001      — enable refused for an instance holding two repositories
  order 28 TC-GL-ONEREPO-002      — one repository saved via filters-sync enables and syncs alone
