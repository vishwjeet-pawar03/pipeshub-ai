"""GitLab connector fixtures.

- session-scoped ``gitlab_rest`` (skips when the PAT is missing)
- module-scoped ``gitlab_connector``: discovers fixture shapes read-only against the
  primary project, registers a PipesHub connector scoped to exactly that project,
  waits for one sync, snapshots baselines, then tears the connector down.

Setup **never writes to the primary project**. Its only writes are to the mutation
project, and only to reap artifacts leaked by runs that no longer exist. The shared
connector syncs exactly once, here — no test resyncs it — so the baselines
snapshotted below cannot be moved by anything a concurrent run does.

Auth note: the connector registers only ``AuthType.OAUTH``, but the OAuth gate on
``toggle_sync`` checks nothing beyond the presence of ``credentials.access_token`` in
the KV config, and the GitLab client hands whatever it finds to ``python-gitlab`` as a
bearer token. A Personal Access Token is therefore indistinguishable from an OAuth
access token to the connector, which is what lets this suite authenticate
non-interactively without any connector change.
