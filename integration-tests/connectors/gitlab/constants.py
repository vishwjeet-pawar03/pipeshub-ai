"""Shared constants for the GitLab connector integration tests.

Environment carries the tenant values (token, instance, group, projects); fixture
*shapes* are discovered by the conftest against the live group, so a re-provisioned
fixture needs no code change here. Only the two frozen blocks snapshots and the
pinned merge request are addressed by number, because their content is compared
byte-for-byte or mutated in place.

Concurrency contract: the primary project is read-only for every run, forever.
Mutations go to the mutation project, tagged with this process's ``GL_IT_RUN_ID`` —
issue/MR titles via ``artifact_title``, code files via ``it_path`` — so a run can
clean up exactly its own artifacts and never assert on another run's.
