# pyright: ignore-file

"""Google Drive Workspace – who can open what, asked as each person.

The test user owns four files, shared four ways, and both that user and a second
Workspace member log in to PipesHub under their own addresses. Every check opens
the record as one of them, through the same access check search and chat use.

  order 1  TC-DRV-PERM-001  — a file nobody was given stays with its owner
  order 2  TC-DRV-PERM-002  — a file shared with the second user opens for them
  order 3  TC-DRV-PERM-003  — shared with everyone in the domain (known gap, xfail)
  order 4  TC-DRV-PERM-004  — taking the share away removes their access, not the owner's
