"""Demo-data acceptance test fixtures.

The connector suite seeds a cloud LLM and embedding model before any test
runs (``connectors/conftest.py``). That is right for the fresh stack CI
brings up, but an instance that already has data indexed refuses to change
its embedding model. Set ``DEMO_ACCEPTANCE_USE_INSTANCE_MODELS=1`` to run
this test against such an instance with the models it already has.

A golden question may list plain-English facts (``answer_must_state``) that an
AI judge checks the answer against; see ``answer_judge`` in the demo harness.
The judge uses the ``JUDGE_*`` settings when ``JUDGE_PROVIDER`` is set (an
incomplete set is a judge error), otherwise the same ``TEST_AZURE_OPENAI_*``
settings the suite gives the instance (``EVAL_PROVIDER`` overrides). Without
any, those facts are "not judged", which fails when
``PIPESHUB_REQUIRE_JUDGE=1``, as the workflow sets it.
