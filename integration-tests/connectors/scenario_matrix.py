"""One set of sync scenarios, run against every connector that plugs in an adapter.

Every connector suite had its own idea of what "incremental sync works" means,
and most checked only the graph. This module asks the same questions of each
connector, and asks every store:

- add: the new item becomes a record, gets vectors holding its text, and the
  owner can find it in search;
- update content: the record's vectors are replaced (the new text is there, the
  old text is gone) and search finds the new text;
- update metadata: a rename changes the record in place (same record, new name);
- update permissions: sharing with a second person lets them open and find it,
  and unsharing takes that away again;
- delete: the record, its vectors and its search hit are gone;
- full sync: every record survives with the same id and stays searchable, and
  an item the connector never saw is picked up;
- filter change: an already-synced item that the new filter excludes is removed
  from every store (graph, vectors, blob storage and MongoDB), and the rest stay
  searchable;
- indexing settings change: with manual indexing switched on, a new item is
  synced but not indexed;
- scheduled sync: with a one-minute schedule, a change lands without anyone
  triggering a sync.

A connector plugs in with two things, both in a ``*_scenario_matrix_test.py``
module next to its suite:

1. A ``ScenarioAdapter`` subclass that performs the source-side actions against
   the real service or container (create, update, rename, share, delete, and the
   filter that excludes one item).
2. A test class that subclasses ``ConnectorScenarioMatrix``, carries the
   connector's pytest marker (so it runs in that connector's shard), names the
   actions its source cannot do in ``UNSUPPORTED``, and lists any product bug
   found by reading the code in ``KNOWN_BUGS`` (strict xfail). The module also
   defines a module-scoped ``scenario_adapter`` fixture that creates the
   connector and yields the adapter.

Rounds are shared. Every item the scenarios need is created in one go and synced
once; every mutation is applied in one go and synced once. Each test then checks
its own part. That keeps a connector's whole matrix to a handful of syncs, which
is what makes it affordable in the nightly shards.

Waits poll real conditions (a record's status, its vectors' text, a search hit),
never fixed sleeps. The matrix runs on the Neo4j leg only, unless
``SCENARIO_MATRIX_GRAPHS`` says otherwise (see ``graph_leg_skip``).
