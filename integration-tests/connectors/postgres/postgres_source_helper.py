"""Seeds a PostgreSQL database with tables for the PostgreSQL connector to sync.

The object-store suites upload files; this one creates tables and inserts rows.
That is the only difference — everything after the data is in place (creating the
connector, waiting for the sync, checking the graph) is shared.

psycopg is used directly rather than through an ORM: the point is to control
exactly what schema the connector sees.
