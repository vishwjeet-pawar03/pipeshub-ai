PostgreSQL Connector – Integration Tests
========================================

Tests receive a fully set-up connector via the ``postgres_connector`` fixture
(defined in conftest.py), which creates the tables, creates the connector and
waits for a full sync, then tears both down.

PostgreSQL here is a connector *source* — a database to be indexed — not a store
the platform uses. Like MinIO, it runs in the integration stack, so this
connector has live coverage without an external database.

Test cases:
  TC-SYNC-001 — Full sync + graph validation
  TC-INCR-001 — A table added after the first sync appears on the next one
  TC-ROWS-001 — Adding rows to an existing table does not duplicate its record
