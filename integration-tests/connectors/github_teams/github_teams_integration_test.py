GitHub Teams Connector – Integration Tests (pre-provisioned, read-only + self-cleaning mutations)
=================================================================================================

Scope comes from ``GH_TEAMS_TEST_ORG`` + the three repo env vars; fixture *shapes* are
discovered by the conftest rather than pinned, so a re-provisioned org needs no code
change. Only the two frozen blocks snapshots are pinned by number.

Every CI leg, every PR and the nightly cron share ONE GitHub org, and different PRs run
at the same time. The primary and public repos are therefore never written to: the three
mutation tests (orders 18-20) each create a throw-away connector scoped to the *mutation*
repo and assert by external id, so nothing another run does can reach an assertion here.
Code mutations are further confined to ``it/<run_id>/`` — the connector only syncs the
default branch, so concurrent runs share it and only a path namespace keeps them apart.
``README.md`` in this directory is the contract for adding tests.

  order 1  TC-SYNC-001            — full sync baseline + graph self-consistency
  order 2  TC-GH-RG-001           — org/repo/child record-group hierarchy + App edge
  order 3  TC-GH-USER-001         — AppUsers, USER_APP_RELATION, team→app gate edge
  order 4  TC-GH-ISSUE-001        — reference issue TICKET properties
  order 5  TC-GH-ISSUE-002        — hierarchy + BLOCKS relation + entity relations
  order 6  TC-GH-ATTACH-001       — issue AND PR body attachments exist after base sync
  order 7  TC-GH-ATTACH-002       — those attachment records index to COMPLETED
  order 8  TC-GH-ISSUE-BLOCKS-001 — streamed issue blocks snapshot
  order 9  TC-GH-PR-001           — merged PR PULL_REQUEST properties
  order 10 TC-GH-PR-BLOCKS-001    — streamed PR blocks snapshot
  order 11 TC-GH-CODE-001         — code file + folder record properties
  order 12 TC-GH-CODE-HIER-001    — folder PARENT_CHILD chain + folder inventory
  order 13 TC-GH-CODE-TS-001      — code/folder source timestamps (polled)
  order 14 TC-GH-PERM-001         — private repo ACL, role mapping, 2-hop inheritance
  order 15 TC-GH-PERM-002         — public repo ORG grant placement (its own connector)
  order 15 TC-GH-PERM-003         — a colleague with no GitHub account: private refused, public opens
  order 16 TC-GH-IDX-001          — indexing reaches COMPLETED / AUTO_INDEX_OFF
  order 17 TC-GH-CKPT-001         — issue / PR / code checkpoints at their exact values
  order 18 TC-INCR-ISSUE-001      — new issues (one pre-closed → DONE), then edit + not_planned close
  order 19 TC-INCR-PR-001         — PR update-only: no new record, version += 1; closed PR → CANCELLED
  order 20 TC-INCR-CODE-001       — new/update/rename/move/delete in one commit set; untouched file stable
  order 21 TC-FILTER-001          — REPO_IDS scoping: unlisted repos do not sync
  order 22 TC-FILTER-002          — Index Code Files off: records exist, AUTO_INDEX_OFF
  order 23 TC-GH-FILTEROPT-001    — org/repo picker options, search ranking, paging
  order 24 TC-GH-ONEREPO-001      — enable refused for an instance holding two repositories
  order 25 TC-GH-ONEREPO-002      — one repository saved via filters-sync enables and syncs alone
