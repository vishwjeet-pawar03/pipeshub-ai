"""Shared constants for the GitHub Teams connector integration tests.

Environment carries only tenant-specific values — the PAT and the three IT repo
names. Everything else is either pinned here (the two frozen blocks snapshots,
which must not drift or the expected JSON is meaningless) or *discovered* by the
conftest against the live org, the way the Jira suite discovers its epic/subtask/
attachment shapes rather than hard-coding issue keys that rot.

Concurrency contract (see README.md): the primary and public repos are read-only
for every run, forever. Mutations go to the mutation repo, and everything a run
writes there is tagged with this process's ``GH_IT_RUN_ID`` — issue/PR titles via
``artifact_title``, code files via ``it_path`` — so a run can identify and clean up
exactly its own artifacts and never assert on another run's.
