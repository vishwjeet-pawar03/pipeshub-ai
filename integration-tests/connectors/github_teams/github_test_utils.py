# pyright: ignore-file

"""GitHub API helpers for the GitHub Teams integration tests.

Two halves:

*Reads* — discovery against the live org. The suite deliberately discovers its
fixture shapes (multi-assignee issue, sub-issue pair, blocking pair, merged PR,
nested code path) instead of pinning issue numbers, so a re-provisioned fixture org
needs no code change. Only the two frozen blocks snapshots are pinned.

*Writes* — everything the incremental cases need. ``GitHubAsyncDataSource`` is
read-only (34 methods, all GET), so both halves go through ``GitHubAsyncRESTClient``,
the raw client the data source itself wraps: same auth header, same media type, same
API version, and raw JSON rather than attribute-wrapped objects.

Code-file mutations use the **Git Data API**, not the Contents API. Contents writes
one file per commit and expresses a rename as delete-then-add across two commits;
the Git Data API builds a single tree and a single commit, so GitHub's compare
reports a genuine ``renamed`` entry with ``previous_filename`` and the connector's
``_classify_compare_files`` sees the real rename path rather than the
``_reconcile_sha_moves`` fallback.
