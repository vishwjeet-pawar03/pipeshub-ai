"""GitHub Teams connector fixtures.

- session-scoped ``github_rest`` (skips when the PAT is missing)
- module-scoped ``github_connector``: discovers fixture shapes read-only against the
  primary + public repos, registers a PipesHub connector scoped to exactly those two,
  waits for one sync, snapshots baselines, then tears the connector down.

Setup **never writes to the primary or public repos**. Its only writes are to the
mutation repo, and only to reap artifacts leaked by runs that no longer exist. The
shared connector syncs exactly once, here — no test resyncs it — so the baselines
snapshotted below cannot be moved by anything another concurrent run does.

Auth note: the connector registers only ``AuthType.OAUTH``, but the OAuth gate on
``toggle_sync`` checks nothing more than the presence of ``credentials.access_token``
in the KV config, and ``GitHubClientViaToken`` passes whatever it finds to
``Auth.Token``. A classic PAT is therefore indistinguishable from an OAuth access
token to the connector, which is what lets this suite authenticate non-interactively
without any connector change. See ``README.md``.
