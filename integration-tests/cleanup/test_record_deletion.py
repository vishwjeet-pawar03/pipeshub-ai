"""Deleting a record has to clear all four stores.

A record's data lives in four places — the graph, the vector database, blob
storage and MongoDB — and until now only the graph was ever checked after a
delete. These tests check each store separately, so a failure names the store
that kept the data rather than reporting one undifferentiated "cleanup failed".

Two of the four currently fail, and are marked as expected failures with the
reason recorded against each. They are written as assertions of correct
behaviour rather than of today's behaviour: pinning the current result would
make the bug permanent, and the strict marker means that whoever fixes it is
told to remove the marker rather than left wondering.

The markers are deliberately on separate one-store tests. A strict expected
failure applies to a whole test, so combining stores into a single test would
let a regression in the working stores hide behind the known failure in the
broken ones.
