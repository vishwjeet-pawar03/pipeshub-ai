"""Deleting a whole collection has to clear all four stores too.

Deleting a collection is a different code path from deleting a record, and it
behaves the same way: the graph and the vector database are cleared, blob
storage and MongoDB are not. Testing both is what shows the gap is in the
delete design rather than in one endpoint — a distinction that decides whether
the fix is one call or a shared step every delete path needs.
