"""Fixtures for the cross-store cleanup scenarios.

Every scenario needs the same two things: a record that genuinely exists in all
four stores, and a note of what those stores held before it was deleted. The
note has to be taken first — once the record is gone the graph no longer knows
its virtual record id, and blob storage and MongoDB are both keyed on it.

The virtual record id is read from the record itself rather than from whatever
the vector database happens to return first. With more than one record indexed
those are not the same answer, and the wrong one silently points every
assertion at another record's data.
