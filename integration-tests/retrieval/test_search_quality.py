"""Does search return the right documents?

Ten integration tests cover search today and every one of them is about search
*history* — listing it, sorting it, sharing a saved search, archiving one. None
asks what a query returns. On a product whose purpose is search, the result a
person actually sees is untested.

These tests query a corpus with known right answers and check which document
came back. They assert **rank**, not score: scores move with the model and the
corpus, so a threshold would be a number nobody could justify and everybody
would eventually raise. "The right document came first" is a claim that stays
true and stays meaningful.
