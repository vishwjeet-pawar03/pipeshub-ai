"""Arithmetic for the scale and stress runs, with no stack or network in sight.

A long run can pass every threshold and still be telling us something bad: a
stack that indexes 90 files a minute for the first ten minutes and 20 a minute
by the end has a problem that an average hides. ``drift`` compares the start of
a run with its end so that shows up — but only over the slices where files were
still queued, because every run empties its queue at the end and that tail is
not a slowdown. ``overload_verdicts`` answers the stress run's question, which
is not "how fast" but "did anything get lost".
