"""Shared plumbing for the performance benchmarks: log in, seed a knowledge
base with a synthetic corpus, and watch records until the indexer is done.

``bench_indexing.py`` measures that seeding; ``bench_query.py`` only needs it
to finish before it starts asking questions. Both drive the same public API the
