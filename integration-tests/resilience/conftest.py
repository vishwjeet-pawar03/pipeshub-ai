"""Fixtures for breaking a dependency of the running stack on purpose.

These tests restart the broker, the vector database, or the indexing process
while documents are being indexed. That disturbs anything else using the
stack, so they carry their own marker and run on their own, after the rest of
the suite (see the integration workflow).
