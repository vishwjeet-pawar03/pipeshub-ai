"""Container-scoped permission filtering, against a real vector store.

Everything else about this filter can be unit-tested, but not the thing that
matters most: whether a provider actually *enforces* `must` AND at-least-one
`should`. That is server-side semantics. A provider that treated the should
clauses as scoring hints — which is exactly OpenSearch's default when a `must`
clause is present — would return every document in the org, and every unit test
would still pass because the generated query looks right.

So the load-bearing assertion here is the negative one: a point matching `orgId`
but none of the container clauses must not come back.

Requires: docker compose -f deployment/docker-compose/docker-compose.integration.vector-db.yml up -d
Run: pytest tests/integration/vector_db/test_container_filter_integration.py -m integration --timeout=120
