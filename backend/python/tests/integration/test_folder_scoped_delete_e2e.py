"""Folder deletes stay inside the folder, on a real Neo4j and a real ArangoDB.

``delete_records_recursive`` is the one delete path for files and folders. Two
guarantees are pinned here, on both backends:

* With ``within_folder_id``, a root is deleted only if it sits under that folder
  through containment edges (PARENT_CHILD / ATTACHMENT). A record in a sibling
  folder is kept even when a RELATED or DERIVED_FROM edge links it to the folder's
  contents, and a record moved out of the folder is kept. The check runs in the
  delete's own query, so there is no window between checking and deleting. A
  record moved into the subtree mid-delete is never left under a deleted parent:
  Neo4j deletes and reports it, ArangoDB stops the delete.
* A cascade follows containment edges only. On ArangoDB it used to filter on the
  last edge of each path, so it walked through a RELATED edge and deleted the
  target's children.

The tree::

    folder_a/            folder_a -RELATED-> b_sub
      a1                 a1 -DERIVED_FROM-> b1
        (attachment)     a1 -ATTACHMENT-> attached
      sub/
        s1
    folder_b/
      b1
      b_sub/
        b_sub_file
    root_file

Runs in backend-matrix on both graph jobs. Environment: NEO4J_IT_URI,
NEO4J_IT_PASSWORD, ARANGO_IT_URL, ARANGO_IT_PASSWORD.
