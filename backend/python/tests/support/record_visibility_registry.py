"""What every record-reading method of ``IGraphDBProvider`` returns for a record in the trash.

A record is in the trash while ``isDeleted`` is true. Each method is in exactly
one class:

``PARAM``  takes ``visibility: RecordVisibility`` (default ``LIVE``).
``LIVE``   always leaves trashed records out; no caller may see them.
``ALL``    returns trashed records too, on purpose; the reason says why.
``WRITE``  changes records rather than reading them.

``tests/unit/services/graph_db/test_record_visibility_registry.py`` fails when a
record method on the interface is missing here, and
``tests/integration/test_record_visibility_e2e.py`` checks the classes against a
real Neo4j and a real ArangoDB. Adding a method to the interface means adding it
here, which means deciding what it does with the trash.
