"""What each tool tells the model about itself, during an eval run.

A stub that advertises itself as harmless cannot test whether the agent asks
before it writes: the model would be believing the tool card, not misbehaving.
So a stub keeps the real tool's name, description, parameters and tags, and
replaces only what happens when it is called.

Where the real tool can be imported cheaply, its own metadata is read straight
off it. The knowledge-graph and Jira tools pull in the retrieval stack (and
torch) on import, which a scheduled eval has no use for, so those carry a card
written to match the real tool's contract. ``test_scheduled_evals.py`` pins the
part that matters — a write tool must read as one.
