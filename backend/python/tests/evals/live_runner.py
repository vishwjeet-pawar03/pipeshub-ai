"""Run the golden cases against a real model.

``live_harness.run_golden_evals`` takes a ``run_agent`` callable and marks every
case skipped without one. This module supplies that callable: it builds a real
``Agent`` on the real runtime, with the real system prompt, gives it the tools
each case grants, and turns the run's result into the ``TraceResult`` the
assertions read.

Only the tools' ``execute`` is stubbed. Their names, descriptions, parameters
and tags are the real ones (see ``tool_cards.py``), because a stub that tells
the model it "changes nothing" cannot test whether the agent asks before it
writes — a write without asking would be the model believing the tool card
rather than misbehaving.

The prompt comes from ``PipesHubPromptBuilder``, the one production builds, so
a change to the prompt or to the rules it assembles reaches this eval. Two
hand-written sentences here would have meant the thing most likely to regress
was the thing never tested.

What this does NOT measure: retrieval quality, citation correctness, or answers
over real customer data. Those need the stack and belong with the integration
and browser tests.
