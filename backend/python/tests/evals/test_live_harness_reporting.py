"""The live harness must not report a run that measured nothing as passing.

`run_golden_evals` takes an optional `run_agent`. Without it no case executes.
Reporting those cases as passed turns "nothing ran" into a green result, which
is more dangerous than a red one because nobody investigates a green build —
and this harness is intended to be wired into a scheduled job, where a silent
skip could go unnoticed indefinitely.

These tests run offline: no model, no API key.
