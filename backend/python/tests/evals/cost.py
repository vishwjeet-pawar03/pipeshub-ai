"""What a run of the golden evals cost, in dollars.

The agent runtime counts tokens for every model call in a run
(``AgentResult.usage``), so the arithmetic here is tokens × a published price.
Providers do not return a price, so the table below is copied from their public
pages and carries the date it was read: a stale table gives a wrong number
quietly, and a dated one at least says when it was last true.

An unknown model is not priced at zero — that would report a free run. The cost
is reported as unknown instead, and the summary says which model needs a price.
