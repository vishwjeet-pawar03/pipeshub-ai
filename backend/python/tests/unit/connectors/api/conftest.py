"""Shared setup for the router tests.

Break the router <-> edition_config import cycle before collection.
`app/connectors/api/router.py` imports `app.edition_config`, which can import
the router back while it is still half-built and `ImportError`. A full
`pytest tests/unit` run survives only by accident of alphabetical collection;
scope the run to this directory and twelve router modules fail at collection.
Importing `edition_config` here drives it to completion first.

Pin the base connector resolvers. `app.edition_config` hands the router its
resolvers and an edition may swap them. These tests mock a plain container and
config service to exercise the router itself, so they need the base resolvers
on every edition; an edition's own resolvers are covered by its own tests.
