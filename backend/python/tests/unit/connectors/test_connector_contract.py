"""Contract every registered connector has to satisfy.

Integration tests for connectors need a live account at the provider, which is
why only a minority of the shipped connectors have one. These do not: they hold
the whole registry to the shape `BaseConnector` defines, using nothing but
imports and reflection.

That covers a specific and recurring class of regression. When an abstract
method is added to `BaseConnector`, or `create_connector`'s signature changes,
or a connector module is renamed, the break is not visible at import time — it
surfaces the first time somebody syncs that one source, on the connector nobody
happened to try. Every connector is checked here on every pull request instead.

What these cannot tell you is whether a connector still talks to its provider
correctly. A rotated scope or a retired endpoint is only caught by
`integration-tests/connectors/`, which needs credentials.
