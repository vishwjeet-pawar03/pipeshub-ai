"""Guards on the Acme Corp demo fixture that are cheap enough for every pull request.

The demo's acceptance test asks the golden questions against a running
instance, so it only runs nightly. These catch the ways the demo has already
gone wrong, or nearly did, without an instance:

- links that point at real third-party accounts instead of a reserved domain;
- suggested questions on the chat landing that drift from the questions the
  acceptance test actually scores;
- expectations that name records the fixture no longer has;
- the permissions lesson (only the pricing committee sees pricing) quietly
  disappearing.
