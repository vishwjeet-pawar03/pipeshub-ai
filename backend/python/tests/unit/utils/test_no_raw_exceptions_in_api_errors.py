"""Stop raw exception text reaching people through API errors.

Three shapes are caught: the exception handed over on the spot (``detail=str(e)``),
parked in a variable first (``error_msg = f"…{e}"`` … then ``detail=error_msg``),
and passed to a helper that builds the body (``_error_response(500, str(e))``).
The last two read as fixed messages on the raising line.

A line ending ``# user-written message`` is skipped: a few handlers re-raise our
own exceptions whose text was written for the person asking.

The web app shows an API error's ``message``/``reason``/``detail`` word for word,
so ``detail=str(e)`` puts a Python repr in a toast. These files still hold a few
such spots; this test fails when a file gains one, so the count only goes down.

To lower a baseline after cleaning a file up, run this test — the failure message
prints the new count — and set it here.
