        """When a reference-style image and inline image overlap in position,
        the inline replacer should skip it."""
        # This is tricky because the reference pattern and inline pattern
        # both match the same syntax. We create content where the reference
        # pattern matches at a position, and then the inline pattern would
        # also match at that same start position.

        # Reference-style: ![alt][ref] - matches first
        # After reference replacement: ![Image_1][ref]
        # The inline pattern won't match ![Image_1][ref] because it expects (url)
        # So we need a more specific test.

        # The skip happens when reference_positions contains match.start()
        # for the inline matcher. This occurs when both patterns match at
        # the same start position.

        # Actually, looking at the code more carefully:
        # reference_positions tracks start positions of reference-style matches
        # Then the inline replacer checks if match.start() is in reference_positions
        # But after reference replacement, the inline pattern won't re-match
        # at the same position because the text has been replaced.

        # The scenario is: the markdown_img_pattern (inline) could match
        # a reference-style image because ![alt][ref] could partially
        # match the inline pattern if ref looks like a URL.

        # Actually, ![alt](url) and ![alt][ref] are different syntaxes,
        # but the inline pattern could match something like ![alt](ref]
        # if there's overlap. The key insight is that reference_positions
        # is populated from the ORIGINAL content, but the inline replacer
        # runs on the MODIFIED content (after reference replacement).

        # Wait - looking at the code again:
        # reference_positions is built from the ORIGINAL md_content
        # The inline replacer runs on modified_content (after ref replacement)
        # So the positions in reference_positions correspond to the original
        # content, not the modified one. After reference replacement, positions
        # may shift.

        # The line 127 code is: if match.start() in reference_positions: return match.group(0)
        # This means: if the inline pattern matches at a position where we
        # previously saw a reference-style image, skip it.

        # To trigger this, we need content where:
        # 1. The reference_usage_pattern matches at position X
        # 2. After reference replacement, the markdown_img_pattern ALSO matches
        #    at position X (same start position)

        # The reference pattern replaces ![alt][ref] with ![Image_N][ref]
        # The inline pattern matches ![alt](url)
        # These are different syntaxes, so they won't normally overlap at
        # the same start position.

        # However, if we have content like:
        # ![alt][ref1](url) - this matches both patterns starting at position 0
        # The reference pattern matches ![alt][ref1]
        # The inline pattern matches ![alt][ref1](url) where [ref1](url) looks like a URL

        # Actually, the inline pattern is: !\[([^\]]*)\]\(([^\s)]+)(?:\s+"[^"]*")?\)
        # And the reference pattern is: !\[([^\]]*)\]\[([^\]]+)\]
        # If we have: ![alt][ref](url)
        # Reference matches: ![alt][ref] at position 0
        # After replacement: ![Image_1][ref](url)
        # Inline pattern tries to match ![Image_1][ref](url)
        # But inline pattern expects ](url) not ][ref](url)

        # Let me think differently. The reference_positions set is populated
        # from ORIGINAL content. The inline replacer runs on MODIFIED content.
        # But the match.start() positions are from the modified content.
        # If reference replacement preserves positions (same length), they could match.

        # Actually, the simplest way to trigger line 127 is when the content
        # has something that matches both patterns at the same start position
        # in the original content. After reference replacement, the inline
        # pattern would match at the same start position in the modified content.

        # Example: ![alt](url)[ref] - but this doesn't match reference pattern.

        # Let me look at this differently. The reference pattern matches first
        # and replaces in the content. Then the inline pattern runs on the result.
        # For line 127 to be hit, the inline pattern must find a match in the
        # modified content at a position that existed in reference_positions
        # (from the original content).

        # If we have: ![ref_img][r1] ![inline_img](url.png)
        # Reference positions: {0} (where ![ref_img][r1] starts)
        # After ref replacement: ![Image_1][r1] ![inline_img](url.png)
        # Inline matches: ![inline_img](url.png) at some position > 0
        # So inline match position != 0, no skip.

        # For the skip to happen, we need the inline match in modified content
        # to be at the same position as a reference match in original content.

        # If replacement keeps exactly the same length:
        # ![x][r] is 7 chars. ![Image_1][r] is 13 chars. NOT same length.
        # So positions after the reference replacement shift.

        # Unless the replacement happens to produce something that the
        # inline pattern matches at position 0 in modified_content,
        # and position 0 was in reference_positions.

        # The only reliable way: have content starting with a reference image
        # where after replacement, the inline pattern also matches at position 0.
        # ![x][r] replaced with ![Image_1][r]
        # Inline pattern: !\[([^\]]*)\]\(([^\s)]+)... won't match ![Image_1][r]

        # I think line 127 is effectively dead code for normal inputs.
        # But we can still test it by constructing a pathological input.

        # Alternative: test it by manipulating reference_positions directly.
        # Since we can't access the closure, let's create content where
        # both patterns match at the same position.

        # Actually, the simplest test: have content that looks like both
        # an inline AND reference image simultaneously.
        # Content: ![alt](url.png)[refid] - no, this is just an inline image
        # followed by [refid].

        # Let me try: we can have content where the inline pattern and
        # reference pattern both match at position 0 of the original content.
        # For that we need something like:
        # ![alt][ref](extra) -- reference matches ![alt][ref]
        # Then after ref replacement: ![Image_1][ref](extra)
        # And inline matches... no, ![Image_1][ref](extra) doesn't match inline.

        # OK, I think the way to test this is with a more creative approach.
        # What if we have an image syntax that could be parsed as both?
        # ![text](url) where the URL contains brackets: ![text]([url])
        # Reference: !\[([^\]]*)\]\[([^\]]+)\] -- needs ][
        # Inline: !\[([^\]]*)\]\(([^\s)]+)... -- needs ](

        # What about: ![foo][bar](baz.png)
        # Reference matches: ![foo][bar] at position 0
        # reference_positions = {0}
        # After replacement: ![Image_1][bar](baz.png)
        # But ![Image_1][bar](baz.png) -- inline pattern needs ]( which is at
        # position len("![Image_1][bar") = 14, doesn't match at 0

        # After more thought: line 127 guards against false positives where
        # the inline regex might capture something at a position where
        # a reference was already captured. Let me try with a degenerate case
        # where no actual reference definition exists, so the replacement
        # keeps the same text.

        # Actually, re.sub with replace_reference_image will ALWAYS change
        # the content (replacing alt text), so the positions shift unless
        # the replacement is exactly the same length, which it almost never is.

        # Let me just create a unit test that directly exercises the function
        # with a known content where line 127 would be reached:

        # I'll use content where an inline-looking pattern exists at the
        # exact start position of a reference-style match.
        # The trick: make the alt text exactly "Image_N" length to preserve positions.

        # Actually, the simplest solution: line 127 can be triggered if we have
        # content where reference_positions is populated and then the inline
        # regex matches at one of those exact positions after substitution.

        # Content: "![a]( ref )[b]" -- but this doesn't match ref pattern.

        # I'll give up trying to create a natural scenario and instead test
        # with a synthetic input:

        md = "![a][b](c.png)"
        # Reference pattern: !\[([^\]]*)\]\[([^\]]+)\]
        # This matches ![a][b] at position 0
        # reference_positions = {0}
        # After ref replacement: ![Image_1][b](c.png)
        # Now inline pattern: !\[([^\]]*)\]\(([^\s)]+)...
        # Does ![Image_1][b](c.png) match? Let's see:
        # !\[ matches ![
        # ([^\]]*) captures "Image_1"
        # \] matches ]
        # \( matches ( -- BUT wait, after "Image_1]" we have "[b]", not "("
        # So inline pattern does NOT match at position 0.
        # It might match ![Image_1][b](c.png) as: !\[Image_1\]\[b\]\(c\.png\)
        # No, !\[([^\]]*)\] captures up to the first ], which gives "Image_1"
        # Then \( expects (, but we have [, so no match.

        # Let me try the pattern differently. What if the content after
        # reference replacement has ](url) at position 0?
        # That requires the reference replacement to produce ](url) at pos 0.
        # Not possible since replacer outputs ![Image_N][ref].

        # Conclusion: line 127 is a defensive guard that may not be naturally
        # triggerable with the current regex patterns. Let's skip trying to
        # trigger it naturally and instead verify the function works correctly
        # with the existing tests.

        # However, we CAN test it by mocking the internals or by constructing
        # a very specific scenario.

        # Actually, let me re-read the code flow:
        # 1. reference_positions built from ORIGINAL md_content using reference_usage_pattern
        # 2. modified_content = re.sub(reference_usage_pattern, replace_ref, md_content)
        # 3. modified_content = re.sub(markdown_img_pattern, replace_inline, modified_content)
        # 4. modified_content = process_html_images(modified_content)

        # In step 3, replace_inline checks: if match.start() in reference_positions
        # The match is from modified_content. The positions in reference_positions
        # are from original md_content.

        # If the reference replacement is shorter or longer, positions shift.
        # But if a SECOND inline image exists at a position that happened to be
        # in reference_positions from the original content... unlikely but possible.

        # Simplest trigger: have reference at position 0 with same-length replacement
        # Original: ![XXXXX][r1] has 12 chars (with r1)
        # Replacement: ![Image_1][r1] has 14 chars
        # So if we had a second inline image at position 12 in original,
        # it would be at position 14 in modified. Not at position 0.

        # OK, I genuinely cannot trigger line 127 with real input.
        # The line is dead code for the current regex patterns.
        # Let's at least verify the function handles content correctly
        # in complex scenarios.
