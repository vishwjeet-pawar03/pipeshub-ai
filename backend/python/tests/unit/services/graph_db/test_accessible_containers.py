"""`get_accessible_containers` — what a search may be scoped by.

The container sets *widen*: the vector filter they build admits records the user
cannot read, and `filter_accessible_virtual_record_ids` narrows it back. That
asymmetry decides every bound here. A container wrongly included costs
precision, which the verifier fixes. A container wrongly *omitted* is a record
that never comes back, with no error and nothing to notice — so every limit in
this module falls back to the record-id path rather than truncating.

The pure helpers are where those bounds live, so they are tested directly. The
two query builders need a live graph, so they are held to the same predicates by
reading their source — the pattern `test_records_by_virtual_record_id` uses.
