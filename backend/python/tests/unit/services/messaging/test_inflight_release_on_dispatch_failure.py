"""A message must not stay marked in flight when dispatch fails.

`_start_processing_task` marks a message in flight and then does several things
that can raise before the work is handed to the worker loop: parsing the entry,
deriving its tier, building the gate-waiter token, and creating the wrapper
coroutine.

A message id left behind in `_in_flight_message_ids` is not merely wasted
memory. Nothing ever clears it, and while it is there:

  * the read and dispatch phases skip that entry (`_is_in_flight`), so it is
    never retried, and
  * `__already_held` reports it as held, so the stranded-entry sweep will not
    dead-letter it either.

The record it carries is then never indexed and nothing is logged to say so.
These tests pin the release on each failure point.
