"""Remove records that have been in the trash longer than the retention period.

Runs in-process in the connectors service, which already owns graph deletes and
the message producer. One replica leads at a time, through the same Redis
SET NX lease as the vector membership backfill. The loop wakes every hour and
starts a run when the interval has passed since the last run started, at the
configured hour (UTC).

A run walks each org's trash oldest first, in pages, by
(``deletedAtTimestamp``, key). For each page:

1. The cleanup the page will owe is saved to an outbox in the KV store.
2. The graph delete removes each record's edges, type doc and vertex in one
   transaction, checking again inside it that the record is still in the trash
   and due, so a record restored meanwhile stays.
3. Each removed record gets the hard delete's own events: ``deleteRecord``
   (vectors, stored content of its virtual record, entity point) and
   ``deleteStoredDocuments`` for its uploaded file or stored copy. Then the
   outbox entry goes.

A crash or a broker outage after step 2 leaves the outbox entry; the next tick
publishes the events of every record in it that is gone from the graph and
drops the rest. A record that still has a child, trashed or not, waits: the
org is walked again while a walk both removed something and passed over such
a record, so a trashed tree goes leaves first, one level per walk, in one run.
A page the graph refuses is retried record by record, and a record that fails
is counted (``purgeAttempts``) and left out after ``maxAttempts``. Then the
record groups kept only for the trash (``isDeletedAtSource``) go once nothing
belongs to them.

The purge runs whether ``ENABLE_SOFT_DELETE`` is on or off: turning the trash
off makes new deletes hard deletes, and what is already in the trash is still
removed on schedule. Only ``softDeletePurge.enabled`` pauses it; an unfinished
run resumes from its cursor when it is on again.
