"""
Local FS connector — personal scope, local folder watched by the desktop app.

``run_sync`` is server-driven like every other connector: it pulls pages of
file-event *metadata* from the Electron desktop over an RPC relayed by the
Node service, and applies them. No file bytes cross this path — content is
fetched on demand in ``stream_record``. The server process never crawls
``sync_root_path`` itself.

Full vs incremental is derived from the sync point, per the platform
convention: no ``last_sync_time`` means a completed baseline does not exist
yet, so the next run is FULL.

Sync settings accept ``batchSize`` (preferred) or ``batch_size`` in etcd.
