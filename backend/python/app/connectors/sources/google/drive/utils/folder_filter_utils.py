"""Folder-scope filter primitives shared by the personal and workspace Drive connectors.

The `folder_ids` sync filter restricts a sync to selected folder subtrees. Resolving
that scope needs the same four source walks in both connectors, which differ only in
how they obtain a live datasource (the personal connector must refresh its OAuth
credentials first, the workspace connector holds a per-user impersonated client) and
in which `fields` mask they request. Both are parameters here.
