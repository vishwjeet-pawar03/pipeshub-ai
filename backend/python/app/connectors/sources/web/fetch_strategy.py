"""
Multi-strategy URL fetcher with fallback chain for the web connector.

Fallback chain (default):
  1. aiohttp (existing session, cheapest, already async)
  2. curl_cffi with HTTP/2 browser impersonation
  3. curl_cffi with HTTP/1.1 forced
  4. cloudscraper (JS challenge solver)

Optional headless mode (opt-in per connector instance):
  PlaywrightFetcher — headless Chromium via Playwright.
  Recommended for JavaScript-heavy SPAs or Cloudflare-protected sites.

Each strategy shares the same headers but uses different
TLS fingerprints / impersonation profiles.
