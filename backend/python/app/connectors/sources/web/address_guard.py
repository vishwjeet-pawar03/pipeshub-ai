"""Keeps the Web and RSS connectors' requests off loopback, private, link-local and cloud
metadata addresses, redirects included, using the blocked-address policy in ``app.utils.url_fetcher``.
Each check resolves the host once and the request is sent to that answer, so a second DNS answer
(rebinding) can't move it somewhere the check never saw.
