"""Knowledge-base harness for the Acme Corp fixture.

Uploads the fixture as markdown into knowledge bases on a PipesHub instance,
then asks each golden question N times and scores the citations against the
fixture's must_cite / must_not_cite lists. This is the cheap way to tune the
content before the demo connector exists: the words are identical either way.

What an answer says is scored two ways. ``answer_must_mention`` is an exact,
case-insensitive token ("2.2%", a name); a hyphen and a space between two words
count as the same, so "platform-fee" mentions "platform fee". ``answer_must_state`` (and optionally
``answer_must_not_state``) lists facts as plain sentences, each one fact, the
way a reviewer would check it: "A purchase of up to and including $250 needs
no approval." An AI judge reads the answer against them (``answer_judge.py``
says how it decides). Citations and permission checks never involve the judge.
Run from here, the harness has no judge, so those facts show as "not judged";
the nightly integration test judges them.

Permissions are approximated with two knowledge bases: "shared" (everything
readable by engineering or support) and "restricted" (pricing committee only).
Run with --skip-restricted to model Alice, without it to model Bob.

Once the Demo connector is synced on the instance, the same questions can be
asked through the real permission path instead: --persona alice|bob logs in as
that fixture person (password from $DEMO_PERSONA_PASSWORD), --persona installer
uses the account in --env, and nothing is uploaded.

Usage:
  python kb_harness.py --env bootstrap.env --fixture ../fixture/acme-corp.yaml --runs 3
  python kb_harness.py ... --skip-upload    # KBs already loaded; just ask
  python kb_harness.py ... --persona alice  # connector mode, real permissions
