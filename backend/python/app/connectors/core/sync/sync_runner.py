"""Single body for every connector sync task, regardless of trigger path.

Both the event path (EventService._handle_start_sync) and the startup path
(ConnectorFactory.create_and_start_sync) wrap run_sync() in this coroutine, so
the SYNCING/FULL_SYNCING start status and the IDLE end status are written in
exactly one place — inside the task itself. Writing the start status as the
task's first act (rather than before spawning) is what keeps the stored status
truthful: a task cancelled by a newer one can no longer overwrite the newer
task's status, and startup-resumed syncs become visible.
