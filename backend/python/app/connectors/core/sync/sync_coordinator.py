"""The one thing that decides whether a sync may run, and holds it while it does.

Admission used to be spread across five places — the dispatcher's `is_running`,
the lease, a capacity check, `start_if_idle`, and the consumer's capacity gate —
of which only the lease was authoritative. The other four were approximations,
and the gaps between them produced real defects: a status written after the lease
was released, and an `ignore_local_task` flag whose only purpose was to stop a
finalizer declining the request it was handing back.

So there is one question, `begin()`, answered in one place. Capacity is decided
inside it, in the same critical section that grants the lease, which is what
removes the acquire-check-release window entirely.

The task handle lives on the lease. An `asyncio.Task` cannot cross a process
boundary, so something local must hold it — but it is a *cancellation handle*,
never an input to the admission decision. Tying its lifetime to the lease's is
what keeps that distinction from eroding again.

`LocalSyncCoordinator` is the implementation here: one sync worker, so nothing
outside this process needs excluding and the in-process registry is already
exact. It is installed through `app.edition_services.create_coordinator`, so a
build with a different admission rule supplies its own without touching this
module. Nothing here imports redis.
