# Connectors whose record groups are scoped by their root instead of by the full
# descendant closure. Slack qualifies because grants sit on the channel and every
# thread under it inherits, so carrying one group id per thread buys nothing —
# a busy workspace has ~50x more threads than channels. Records from these
# connectors must set `rootRecordGroupId`; see ROOT_RECORD_GROUP_IDS_FIELD.

# Records granted directly to a user with no container covering them. Expected
# near-empty: app-level connectors write a blanket ORG grant and land in
# app_ids, Drive shared-with-me files get a synthetic group, KB uploads land in
# app_ids. What is left is a record-level connector granting per record while
# creating no record group.
#
# On overflow the whole request falls back to the record-id path. Truncating
# instead would be a permanent, silent, error-free hole — exactly the failure
# mode container filtering is supposed to avoid.

# Ceiling on |app_ids| + |record_group_ids| + |direct_records| in one filter.
# Filter size is what actually breaks: OpenSearch rejects a terms clause above
# index.max_terms_count (65,536 by default) and degrades well before it, Redis
# parses the query string on its main thread outside search-timeout, and Qdrant
# probes the payload index once per value per segment. Far below all three, so
# that hitting it means something is wrong upstream rather than that the tenant
# is merely large.

# Depth for the INHERIT_PERMISSIONS closure when expanding accessible record
# groups. Not a taste call — an invariant: the closure must be at least as deep
# as the per-record verifier, which walks `1..20`. A shallower closure omits
# containers whose records the verifier would have admitted, and a container
# omitted is unrecoverable recall loss with nothing to notice.

def dedupe_agents_by_id(rows: Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]]) -> List[str]:
    """
    Collapse a list of ``{agentId, agentName}`` rows into a list of agent names,
    deduped by ``agentId``.

    Used by ``check_toolset_instance_in_use`` and ``check_connector_in_use`` on
    both Arango and Neo4j providers. Dedupe must happen by id, not by name —
    two distinct agents can legitimately share a display name, and collapsing
    them would under-report the true blocker count in 409 messages.

    Order is preserved: the first occurrence of each ``agentId`` keeps its
    position in the output.

    Args:
        rows: Result rows, each expected to have ``agentId`` and ``agentName``.
              ``None``, empty list, and non-dict entries are tolerated.

    Returns:
        List of agent names (with duplicates allowed for distinct ids).
