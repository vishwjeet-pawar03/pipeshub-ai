"""Opik LLM-call tracing as an `LLMTransport` decorator.

`LLMTransport` (see `transport/base.py`) is the ONE choke point every LLM
call in this library passes through, no matter how it got there:
`Agent.step()`'s main turn loop, the planning/critique/route_task tools,
`parse_intent`, `best_of_n`, the auto-compact summarizer
(`control_plane.py::_make_llm_summarizer`), `RubricGrader`, `SkillExtractor`
— all of them ultimately call `TransportRegistry.resolve(provider)` (either
directly or via `ModelSpec.resolve()` -> `TransportModel`) to get a
transport instance. Wrapping *there* — see `wrap_if_enabled()` below, used
by `ControlPlane.start()` at transport-registration time — traces every one
of those call sites uniformly with zero per-call-site changes, replacing
the legacy pattern of a duplicated `OpikTracer` singleton +
`config={"callbacks": [...]}` at every individual LangChain call site (see
`app/modules/agents/deep/state.py`, `app/modules/agents/qna/nodes.py`,
`app/utils/streaming.py`, `app/api/routes/agent.py` — four separate,
drifting copies). There is no LangChain layer here, so that integration
(`opik.integrations.langchain.OpikTracer`) does not apply; this uses Opik's
own manual span/trace API instead.

Correlation across a whole agent run (multiple turns, each its own LLM
call) comes for free from Opik's own context-managed tracing
(`opik.start_as_current_span`): `opik.context_storage` is itself
contextvar-based, so a span opened here automatically nests under whatever
trace/span is already active in the current asyncio task — including the
per-root-`Agent.run()` trace opened by `agent/__init__.py::Agent.run()` (see
`maybe_start_run_trace`) — with no bespoke correlation plumbing (no second
contextvar, no manual trace-id threading) needed on this side. A call made
with no active trace still gets recorded as its own standalone root trace,
which is why installing this on every transport is safe even for call sites
that run outside any `Agent.run()` (e.g. `run_from_message()`'s pre-run
`IntentParser`/`GoalBuilder` calls).

Tracing must never be able to take down a real LLM call: every Opik
SDK call here is best-effort — failures are logged at DEBUG and the
underlying transport call proceeds untraced. See `_safe_span`.

    Why both exist: our own `OpikTracingTransport`/`maybe_start_named_span`
    spans record a hand-built JSON blob good enough for tool-call/usage
    summaries, but Opik's frontend "Pretty" message view is keyed off
    providers it recognizes from raw LangChain callback data — this is how
    the legacy `chatbot.py`/`utils/streaming.py` path (confirmed rendering
    the system prompt correctly) actually gets traced: it never builds its
    own span JSON, it just hands `config={"callbacks": [opik_tracer]}` to
    `astream()`/`ainvoke()` and lets LangChain's own `on_chat_model_start`
    callback capture the exact `BaseMessage` list — including the
    `SystemMessage` — it sent to the provider. Attaching the same native
