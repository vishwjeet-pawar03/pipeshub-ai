"""Dependency-aware scheduling for a batch of `spawn_agent` tool calls made
in one turn.

Without this module, every `spawn_agent` call in a turn is launched as an
unconditionally concurrent `asyncio.Task` (see `Agent.step()`'s old
pre-launch block) with a completely isolated child context (`AgentRuntime.
run_child()` gives the child a fresh `ContextManager` and only its own
`goal` string — see `runtime/runtime.py`). That is correct for genuinely
independent workstreams, but wrong for a plan like "fetch Jira tickets,
then build a PDF from them": both children start at the same instant, so
the PDF child has no way to see the Jira child's output — it either races
ahead with no data, or the ordering is accidental. Relying on the LLM to
"just sequence dependent calls across turns" (the previous mitigation, see
`app/agents/agent_loop/loops/orchestrator.py`'s Phase 2 instructions) is
not enforcement; nothing failed loudly when the model got it wrong.

This module ports the ordering primitive the legacy LangGraph deep agent
already had right (`app/modules/agents/deep/sub_agent.py`'s event-based
`depends_on` resolution + `context_manager.py`'s dependency-result
injection) into a small, independently testable unit `Agent.step()` and
`SpawnAgentTool.handle()` both call through — the single scheduling
implementation, used identically whether a "batch" has one spawn call or
many:

  - every call in the batch launches immediately as its own `asyncio.Task`
  - a call with `depends_on` waits (via `asyncio.Event`) for each
    prerequisite task_id to finish, THEN receives that prerequisite's
    output appended to its own goal, THEN actually spawns its child
  - calls with no dependency on each other still run fully concurrently —
    no regression for genuinely parallel phases
  - an invalid batch (self-dependency, unknown task_id, duplicate task_id,
    or a dependency cycle) is rejected at validation time, per-call, with a
    corrective message the orchestrator model can act on next turn — never
    a crash, never a silent hang
  - a prerequisite that fails skips the dependent (rather than running it
    against missing data) and reports why

`SPAWN_RESULTS_SLOT` extends this across turns within one run: a
`depends_on` reference can name a task_id spawned (and already completed)
in an EARLIER turn, not just a sibling in the same batch — e.g. "spawn
jira in turn N, spawn pdf depends_on=[jira] in turn N+1" (which the
orchestrator's own Phase 2 loop can still end up doing if the model splits
dispatch across turns) resolves exactly the same way as both calls being
in the same turn.
