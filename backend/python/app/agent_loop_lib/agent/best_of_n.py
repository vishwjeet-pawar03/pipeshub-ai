module, same convention as `observability.py`, so this logic stays
unit-testable without a full Agent/turn loop.

`spawn_agent` and `agent_as_tool()` use — so the max-depth guard, spec
scoping, and cancellation-token propagation all apply unchanged. The only
new piece is the judge: one structured LLM call over the candidates' final
outputs.
