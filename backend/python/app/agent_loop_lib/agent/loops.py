"""LoopStrategy: the SHAPE of an agent's turn loop, inverted from control
(Agent used to own a single fixed `for turn in range(max_turns)` loop with a
handful of before/after mount points) to a driver: a `LoopStrategy` owns the
loop itself and calls `Agent.step()` — the one, fixed, hook-instrumented unit
of "call the model once, maybe run tool calls" — as many times as its shape
needs, in whatever order/branching pattern it wants.

This is the framework's answer to "how do I build a Plan -> Critique ->
Execute -> Verify agent, or an incremental planner, or anything in between"
— write a small class that calls `agent.step()`, `agent.inject_user_message()`,
and `agent.last_tool_result()` in a loop. No Agent/runtime/tool-executor code
changes needed for a new loop shape (Open/Closed): see `examples/` for five
different loops built this way.

Every deterministic concern (budget, cancellation, deadline warnings,
truncation recovery, guardrails, permission/approval) still fires INSIDE
`Agent.step()` via the shared HookRegistry kernel, regardless of which loop
is driving — a loop can change WHEN/HOW OFTEN the model is called, never
whether the deterministic guards run around each call.
