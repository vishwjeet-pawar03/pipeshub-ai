"""The `Model` abstraction: the high-level "answer my calls" interface
`Agent` depends on, distinct from `LLMTransport` (the low-level "speak this
provider's wire protocol" implementation). Before this module, `Agent`
depended directly on a concrete `LLMTransport` — collapsing the
provider-protocol concern and the "what does an agent need from an LLM"
concern into one interface, and making it impossible to compose
cross-cutting behavior (retry, caching, fallback-to-a-second-model) as a
`Model` decorator without reaching back down into transport internals.

Split into three single-method Protocols (Interface Segregation) plus the
concrete `Model` ABC that composes all three: most callers only need ONE of
`complete`/`complete_structured`/`stream` (e.g. `Planner`/`Critic`/
`IntentParser` only ever call `complete_structured`) and should depend on
exactly that, not on every capability a full `Model` happens to offer.
