Error-propagation contract (see `sandbox/coding/base.py::CodeResult`): a

`run_code`/`install_packages` return `ToolOutput(success=True, data=...)`

failures — an unrecognized `sandbox_id`, or the sandbox type not being
registered/enabled — surface as `ToolOutput(success=False, ...)`; any other
unexpected exception (missing runtime, foundational env setup failure) is
caught generically by `ToolExecutor._run` and surfaced the same way.

    Called on EVERY `run_code`/`install_packages` call, fresh sandbox or
    reused — not just at sandbox creation. Two independent reasons feed
    into `peek_staged_input_files()`, each with its own re-upload story:

    - Parent->child handoff (`AgentTool.handle()`) and skill resources
      (`load_skill`) are staged for the FULL span of a `with
      stage_input_files(...):`-wrapped child run / the rest of the agent
      run respectively — re-uploading the same bytes to the same path on
      every call (fresh or reused) is a harmless, idempotent no-op cost,
      not a correctness issue.
    - A PipesHub `input_artifacts` ref (`coding_sandbox_artifact_staging`
      in `sandbox_bridge.py`) is resolved fresh PER CALL via
      `set_staged_input_files_for_task()` — a bare, task-local set, not
      the `with`-block above — precisely because the model can (and does)
      pass `input_artifacts` alongside an explicit `sandbox_id` to reuse
      an existing sandbox. That staged content only exists for the
      duration of THIS call's task, so it MUST be uploaded here
      regardless of `is_fresh_sandbox`, or those bytes are resolved by
      the PRE hook and then silently dropped on the floor.

    Also covers the pre-existing case this replaces: a child that
    pre-warms with `install_packages` first, then reuses that
    `sandbox_id` for every `run_code`, still gets
    `input/parent_tool_results.json` — that promise ("pre-loaded as soon
