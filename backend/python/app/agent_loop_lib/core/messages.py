"""The message model: a discriminated union of role-specific message types,
replacing the old monolithic `Message` (one class for all four roles, with
role-specific fields all declared optional regardless of which role actually
uses them — an SRP/LSP violation: a `UserMessage` had a meaningless
`tool_call_id` field, a `ToolMessage` had a meaningless `tool_calls` field).

Modeled after Pydantic AI's `ModelMessage`/Agno's message parts: each
concrete class only declares the fields that make sense for its role, and
`Message` is the `Annotated[Union[...], Field(discriminator="role")]` alias
used everywhere a heterogeneous, role-agnostic list is needed (conversation
history, `AgentTurn.messages`, transport payloads, ...). The discriminator
also fixes a latent deserialization bug the old design had no protection
against: without it, `list[ContentPart]`-shaped fields silently drop
subclass-specific data on round-trip (Pydantic falls back to the first
union member that structurally matches).

`MessageRole` is kept as a plain `str` `Enum` purely as an ergonomic set of
comparison constants — `msg.role == MessageRole.TOOL` still reads naturally
and still evaluates correctly (each concrete class's `role` is a `Literal`
matching the enum's own string value, and `str, Enum` members compare equal
to their plain string value in both directions). It is NOT what makes the
four message types polymorphic; the discriminated union is.
