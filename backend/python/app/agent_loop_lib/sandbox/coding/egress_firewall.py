"""Egress policy for sandbox containers that join the egress bridge.

A Docker bridge only keeps sandboxed code off sibling containers *by name*.
By address it still reaches the bridge gateway (the host, or under
Docker-in-Docker the application pod itself), every RFC1918 / CGNAT range the
host can route to, and the cloud metadata endpoints.

So every container that joins the bridge starts as root with just enough
capability to install ``OUTPUT`` rules in its own network namespace, then
``exec``s the real command through ``setpriv`` as an unprivileged user with
an empty capability bounding set and ``no_new_privs``. The rules are in place
before any untrusted code runs, live and die with the container, and the
code can neither change them (no ``NET_ADMIN``) nor go around them (no
``NET_RAW``). Nothing on the host is modified.

If the image can't install the rules (no ``iptables``/``setpriv``), the
container exits with ``FIREWALL_UNAVAILABLE_EXIT_CODE`` and a marker on
stderr before running the command; callers detect that with
``firewall_unavailable``. The marker carries a per-container token that only
the setup script holds — ``exec setpriv`` replaces the script before the
command starts — so the command can't fake the signal.
