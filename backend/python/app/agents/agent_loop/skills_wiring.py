"""Phase 3 of the plan: wires agent_loop_lib's Skills subsystem (Phase 1's
library extensions + Phase 2's `app/agents/agent_loop/skills/` adapters)
into `PipesHubAgentFactory.create()`. Kept in its own module (rather than
inlined into `factory.py`) so the already-long factory stays readable and
this feature's env gate/wiring is one grep away.

Entirely gated by `PIPESHUB_ENABLE_SKILLS` (default ON) — same rollout
convention as `PIPESHUB_USE_COMPOSED_AGENTS`
elsewhere in this adapter layer: a deployment-level opt-OUT, not an
opt-in, so it stays on unless explicitly disabled (e.g. for a deployment
whose graph DB hasn't provisioned the `agentSkills*` collections/indexes
yet — see `app/schema/arango/documents.py`, `node_schema_registry.py`).
`build_skill_manager()` below still requires a `graph_provider` on the
request regardless of this flag; the flag alone never turns the feature
on for a request that has none.

Four call sites in `factory.py`, in this order:

1. `skills_enabled()` — the gate itself.
2. `build_skill_manager()` — right after `tool_registry` is built, before
   `plan_domain_agents()` runs (see below for why ordering matters).
3. `register_skill_tools()` — same spot, so the 5 skill tools land in
   `plan_domain_agents()`'s registered-tool snapshot. They claim no
   `app_name`/`tool_name` any `DomainAgentDefinition` claims (see
   `domain_agents.py`), so they always fall into the RESIDUAL grant and
   stay on the top-level agent under composition — no `domain_agents.py`
   change needed for THAT; they are meta-capabilities, not a domain.
   The four read-only ones (`DOMAIN_SHARED_SKILL_TOOL_NAMES`, everything
   but the `skill_manage` write surface) are ADDITIONALLY passed as
   `register_domain_agents()`'s `shared_tool_names` so every domain child
   gets them too, not just the top level — otherwise a domain-scoped
   child's own `skill_preloading` pass (see that middleware's docstring)
   could only ever inject a skill's full body, never a "call load_skill
   if relevant" pointer, since it would have no `load_skill` to call.
4. `register_skill_preloading()` — added to `hooks` inside `_build_hooks`
   (PRE_AGENT, deterministic intent-match preload).
5. `register_skill_learning()` — added AFTER `AgentRuntime` is
   constructed (needs `runtime.run_child()` for the skill_writer
   sub-agent) — same `HookRegistry` instance already passed into that
   `AgentRuntime`, so appending to it post-construction is equivalent to
   having registered it earlier.
