"""Phase 8 (+ intent): bridges agent-loop's push-based event delivery
(`EventEmitter.emit()`/`EventSink.write()`, both plain `await`-and-return
coroutines) to FastAPI's `StreamingResponse`, which needs an async generator
that YIELDS SSE lines as they become available while `Agent.run()` is still
executing.

`Agent.run(goal)` is one long-lived coroutine — it doesn't yield control
back to its caller between tool calls the way `graph.astream(...,
stream_mode="custom")` does for the legacy LangGraph path. `QueueEventSink`
gives hooks/`SSEEventEmitter` somewhere to push events to in real time;
`run_agent_loop_stream()` runs the whole agent-loop + finalization flow as a
background task and concurrently drains that queue into SSE-formatted
strings, so the two phases (tool orchestration, then citation formatting of
the agent's own final answer — see `respond.py`'s module docstring for why
this is no longer a second LLM call) stream through the exact same
connection the legacy `stream_response()` generator writes to — same SSE
format, same event names.

The agent is driven via `agent.stream(goal)` rather than plain `agent.run(
goal)` so the terminal turn's answer text streams to the client AS IT
GENERATES (`TerminalAnswerStreamer`, `answer_streamer.py`) instead of only
after the whole run finishes — see that module's docstring for why a turn's
text isn't known to be the final answer until the turn ends.
