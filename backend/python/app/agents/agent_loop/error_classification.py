"""Classifies raw agent/transport error strings into a stable `errorCode`
plus a user-friendly message, so the frontend can render something better
than a raw exception string (e.g. `LLM call failed: LangChain transport
error (complete): Error code: 429 - {...}`) and — for `rate_limit`/
`server_error`/`timeout` — offer a "try again" affordance instead of a dead
end.

`invalid_request` (provider 400) and `request_too_large` (413 / context-
length exceeded) are exceptions to the "never leak provider text" rule:
retrying the same request cannot succeed, so the provider's own
`error.message` is the only useful thing to show (e.g. Groq's
`invalid Qwen3.8 reasoning_effort` or its token-limit detail).
Rate-limit / auth / 5xx bodies still stay canned.

Shared by `RespondPipeline._emit_error_response` (agent run completed with
`success=False`) and `stream_bridge.py`'s top-level exception handler
(anything that blew up before/around the agent run itself), so both error
surfaces produce the same `errorCode` vocabulary for a given underlying
failure.

Deliberately string-matching rather than inspecting exception types: by the
time an error reaches these call sites it has already been flattened to
`AgentResult.error` (a `str`) by `Agent.fail()`, so the original exception
object/type is no longer available.
