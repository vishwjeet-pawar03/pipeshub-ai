"""Classifies raw agent/transport error strings into a stable `errorCode`
plus a user-friendly message, so the frontend can render something better
than a raw exception string (e.g. `LLM call failed: LangChain transport
error (complete): Error code: 429 - {...}`) and — for `rate_limit`/
`server_error`/`timeout` — offer a "try again" affordance instead of a dead
end.

Shared by `RespondPipeline._emit_error_response` (agent run completed with
`success=False`) and `stream_bridge.py`'s top-level exception handler
(anything that blew up before/around the agent run itself), so both error
surfaces produce the same `errorCode` vocabulary for a given underlying
failure.

Deliberately string-matching rather than inspecting exception types: by the
time an error reaches these call sites it has already been flattened to
`AgentResult.error` (a `str`) by `Agent.fail()`, so the original exception
object/type is no longer available.
