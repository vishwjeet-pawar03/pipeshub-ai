"""`artifact_context_reminder`: PRE_TURN hook that surfaces artifacts already
registered for this conversation (from an earlier turn) as a
`goal.constraints` reminder — the SAME injection point
`memory.py::conversation_enrichment` uses for its own "reuse previous
results" nudge, kept as a separate hook rather than folded into that one
since it fires unconditionally (any earlier artifact is worth surfacing),
not only for short "yes"/"do it" follow-ups.

Queries `ArtifactRegistryService` directly (the source of truth) rather
than trying to reconstruct artifact IDs from the bounded, text-only
`previousConversations` tool-result transcript
(`factory.py::_convert_conversation_turn`) — that transcript's `result`
field is a size-capped preview string with no guaranteed parseable
`artifact_id`, while the registry always has the current version/lineage.

To enrich the reminder with tool-call arguments and result summaries
(which the registry does not store), `_extract_conversation_metadata`
cross-references `artifact_id` values from the persisted `tool_results`
entries in `previousConversations` — the same bounded, best-effort data
`_convert_conversation_turn` already reads.  This lets the model see
*how* each artifact was produced (args) and *what* it contains (summary)
without wasting a turn on `retrieve_artifact_content`.

Only fires once per run (`turn_index == 0`): conversation history — and
therefore what already exists — doesn't change within a single ReAct run.
