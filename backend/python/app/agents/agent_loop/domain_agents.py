"""Domain-agent catalog: PipesHub's scoped sub-agents, exposed as tools.

Instead of granting the top-level agent every registered tool schema (30+
per turn), each capability domain becomes ONE `AgentTool` — an entire
ReAct `Agent` (same `agent_loop_lib.Agent` loop, just a narrower
`AgentSpec`) callable like any other tool. The top-level agent reasons
over a handful of high-level delegates plus whatever residual tools no
domain claimed; each child reasons over only its own domain's tools.

Design:

- `DomainAgentDefinition` is pure data (which tools a domain claims, how
  the delegate is described to the calling model, which OTHER domain
  agents it may itself call). Adding a domain = adding one entry to
  `DOMAIN_AGENT_DEFINITIONS`; nothing in `plan_domain_agents()`,
  `register_domain_agents()`, or `PipesHubAgentFactory` changes
  (open/closed).
- Claiming tools off the request's already-loaded `ToolRegistry` is split
  from actually building/registering agents (`plan_domain_agents()` vs.
  `register_domain_agents()`) so callers that need to know the FINAL
  top-level tool grant before a runtime/loop exists (the quick-mode
  planner, see `factory.py`) can do so without any registry mutation, and
  callers that already have a runtime (deep mode's spawn machinery, the
  eventual registration step) can build off that same decision instead of
  re-deriving it. Availability falls out naturally either way: a request
  with no web-search provider configured never loads `web_search`, so no
  `web_agent` is planned and the definition is silently skipped — same for
  `internal_exploration_agent` when no knowledge node is attached (no
  `retrieval`/`knowledgehub` tools load, so nothing is claimed). This IS
  the availability contract for both delegates — no separate gating check
  exists or should be added elsewhere; see `test_domain_agents.py`'s
  `TestAvailabilityGating` for the tests that pin it down.
- Children run through `AgentTool.handle()` → `AgentRuntime.run_child()`
  on the SAME runtime — the shared hook kernel (citations, result
  accumulation, SSE status) and event emitter see child tool calls
  exactly as they see top-level ones, and `RunContext.spawn_depth`
  guards recursion (coding_agent → web_agent is depth 2 of 3).

## Exploration Playbook

You are an ITERATIVE explorer, not a single-shot search box. Keep searching, \
browsing, and fetching until the goal is genuinely satisfied or you have \
exhausted reasonable avenues — do not stop after one empty or thin result.

### Turn 1 — fan out in parallel
- If the goal does not name a specific connector or source, issue ALL of \
these in the SAME turn: one broad search across every source (omit \
`connector_ids`) PLUS one scoped search per source listed below that looks \
relevant to the topic. Independent tool calls issued in one turn run \
concurrently — use that instead of searching sources one at a time across \
turns.
- If the goal DOES name a connector/source, search that one first — but \
still fan out to the others in parallel on a later turn if those results \
are thin.
- If your source list has only ONE connector, also issue a broad search \
(omit `connector_ids` entirely) in that same turn — a single-connector \
inventory does not mean other indexed sources don't exist; the broad call \
catches anything outside that one listed source.

### Iterate when results are thin
- An empty or thin result is a signal to try again, not to conclude "not \
found": reformulate the query (synonyms, broader/narrower terms, different \
phrasing), try `knowledgegraph__navigate(node_id="...")` to browse by \
structure when a keyword search comes up empty, and widen scope to sources \
you did not search on turn 1.

### Navigate when search is insufficient
When a result is a container — an epic, a project, a parent page — its \
sub-items hold the answer to "what is the status of X" or "what is in X". \
Call `knowledgegraph__navigate(node_id="<Record ID>")` to list children \
and linked records, then fetch the ones that matter. Navigate also shows \
that record's own fields (for a ticket: status, assignee, priority).

### Reporting Record IDs for follow-up
When you return your final answer, if a specific record was central to the \
goal but you did NOT fetch its full content, mention its exact `Record ID :` \
value inline next to that finding so the calling agent can fetch it directly.

### Stop condition
- Stop as soon as the goal is genuinely satisfied — do not keep searching \
once you have enough to answer confidently.
- Only report "not found" after you have fanned out across every listed \
source AND tried at least one reformulated query.

    `tool_disclosure="lazy"` if it decided to group this domain's tools
    into lazily-disclosed toolsets. Keeps this module ignorant of env
    flags/thresholds/app_name grouping — see `lazy_tools_wiring.py::
    make_lazy_tools_decider`, the only real implementation of this
    callback today. Defaults to a no-op (every child stays eager, exactly
    today's behavior) when `None`.

    `shared_tool_names`, when given, is granted to EVERY built domain in
    ADDITION to its own claimed tools — for meta-capabilities that no
    single domain "owns" but every domain should still be able to reach
    (today: the read-only skill tools `load_skill`/`skill_search`, passed
    by `factory.py` when the skills subsystem is on). These are NOT
    marked as claimed by anyone: the top level keeps them too (they were
    already in its residual grant before this call, since no
    `DomainAgentDefinition` lists them in `tool_names`/`app_names` — see
    `skills_wiring.py`'s "residual grant" comment), and a name not
    actually registered on `tool_registry` this request (skills
    disabled, or any other tool from a future caller) is silently
    skipped rather than granting a nonexistent tool. Without this, a
    domain agent's own `skill_preloading` PRE_AGENT pass (see that
    middleware's docstring) can only ever inject a skill's full body —
    never a "call load_skill if relevant" pointer, since the domain
    agent would have no `load_skill` to call.
