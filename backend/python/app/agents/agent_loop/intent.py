"""Intent understanding: one free-form agent run (via `SingleShotLoop` +
`task_complete`) that reorganizes the raw user query into a clear, self-
contained restatement (resolving pronouns/follow-ups against conversation
history, surfacing requirements/success criteria) and — for `chatMode ==
"auto"` — also picks quick/react/deep without a second LLM round-trip.

Deliberately reuses `build_capability_context()`, `build_prior_routing_
messages()`, `build_tier_rubric()`, and `build_sql_verify_override()` from
`app.modules.agents.qna.router` rather than re-deriving any of them — the
tier definitions and conversation-history handling must never drift from
what the legacy LangGraph path and `classify_route()` already use.

Output format: the prompt asks for a detailed markdown write-up (headed
sections for the restatement/requirements/success criteria/open
questions, when applicable) and — for auto mode — a trailing tier word.
The output is still NOT parsed into structured fields: the model's
entire markdown text becomes `rewritten_query` (i.e. `Goal.description`)
verbatim, headers and all, and the only extraction is a single-word
regex scan for the `route`. The richer shape is purely for the model's
(and a human reading the trace's) benefit — downstream consumers
(prompt builder, planner prompts) receive the whole thing as one block
of context either way, so there is no schema to drift from or fail
against.
