"""EntityVectorStore — provider-agnostic indexing of knowledge graph entities.

Entities (categories, topics, departments, people, record groups, connectors)
are stored in a dedicated ``entities`` vector collection, separate from the
``records`` document collection.  Each entity point has:

  page_content  = "<name>"  (aliases are payload only — EntityRecord.embedding_text)
  metadata      = EntityRecord.to_vector_payload()  (slim — see models.entities)
  connectorIds / recordGroupIds = top-level payload siblings of metadata, not
                                  nested in it (mirrors the records
                                  collection's VectorChunkPayload) — see
                                  ``upsert_entities_batch``.

The deterministic point ID is derived from ``orgId:entityType:entityId`` via
UUID5 so that re-upserts are idempotent without a prior delete.

Reference counting / provenance (which connectors reference an entity, how
many records link to it) is owned by the graph DB, not this vector index —
this store is a disposable search projection that can be rebuilt from the
graph. Connector-disconnect cleanup here
scrolls only the points scoped to that connector (top-level ``connectorIds``
+ ``metadata.orgId``, the same bound a single filtered delete would use) and
shrinks each one's membership rather than deleting it outright, since a
taxonomy/record-group entity can be shared with another still-live
connector — see ``delete_entities_by_connector``.

Membership arrays (``connectorIds``, ``recordGroupIds``) are merged, not
replaced. The same entity point is shared by every record that references it
(deterministic ID above), but each caller only knows about the one record it
currently has in hand — a plain payload overwrite would leave the point
remembering only the last writer's single group/connector instead of the
union across all of them. See ``_merge_membership`` and the per-entity lock
in ``_entity_lock``.

That lock is keyed by ``(event loop, entity)``, so it serialises writers only
within one loop of one process. It does not cover the two cases that occur in
practice: indexing runs some work on the main loop and some on a worker-thread
loop, which take different locks for the same entity, and separate indexing
workers hold separate instances entirely. Either pair can merge against the
same stale read and drop one another's membership. Search tolerates that:
membership only narrows recall, and every hit is checked against the graph.
The one irreversible step is connector cleanup deleting a point that merely
looks exclusive, so it asks the graph first (``membership_lookup``); the
lost membership itself is restored when the affected record is reindexed.

        A pass's record group and connector ids are **required** (plain id
        sets, not an ACL object; this class stays graph-free), so a direct
        call cannot silently produce an unfiltered, org-wide search. Only
        ``org_wide=True`` drops the membership filter, for callers that verify
        every hit against the graph (``app.modules.retrieval.entity_permissions``).
        Stored membership can be empty or stale, so it is a recall hint, never
        an access check. A pass with no ids and not org-wide returns no hits.

        Filter shape per pass: ``must={orgId[, entityType]}`` AND
        ``should={recordGroupIds, connectorIds}`` (at least one must match).
        There is no ``min_should_match``, since KB records have no record group
        by design and are reachable only via ``connectorIds``.

        Record titles outnumber the other entities by orders of magnitude, and
        in one pool a word shared by many titles pushed the taxonomy entities
        out (KG-14). So when both are asked for, a pass is two requests with
        half of ``top_k`` each, titles apart, merged alternately with the
        other types first. A caller that later sorts by score keeps that order
        only on ties; fused scores are ranks within each request, so the
        result stays roughly alternating.

        Each hit is ``{entityId, entityType, name, canonicalName, score,
        connectorIds, recordGroupIds}``; aliases are a matching aid and are
        not returned (KG-17).

        Raises on a vector DB failure so callers can tell it apart from "no
