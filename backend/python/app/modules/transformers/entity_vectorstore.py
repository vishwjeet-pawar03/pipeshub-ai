"""EntityVectorStore — provider-agnostic indexing of knowledge graph entities.

Entities (categories, topics, departments, people, record groups, connectors)
are stored in a dedicated ``entities`` vector collection, separate from the
``records`` document collection.  Each entity point has:

  page_content  = "<name>"  (aliases are payload only — EntityRecord.embedding_text)
  metadata      = EntityRecord.to_vector_payload()  (slim — see models.entities)
  connectorIds / recordGroupIds = top-level payload siblings of metadata, not
                                  nested in it (mirrors the records
                                  collection's VectorChunkPayload) — see
                                  ``upsert_entities_batch``.

The deterministic point ID is derived from ``orgId:entityType:entityId`` via
UUID5 so that re-upserts are idempotent without a prior delete.

Reference counting / provenance (which connectors reference an entity, how
many records link to it) is owned by the graph DB, not this vector index —
this store is a disposable search projection that can be rebuilt from the
graph. Connector-disconnect cleanup here
scrolls only the points scoped to that connector (top-level ``connectorIds``
+ ``metadata.orgId``, the same bound a single filtered delete would use) and
shrinks each one's membership rather than deleting it outright, since a
taxonomy/record-group entity can be shared with another still-live
connector — see ``delete_entities_by_connector``.

Membership arrays (``connectorIds``, ``recordGroupIds``) are merged, not
replaced. The same entity point is shared by every record that references it
(deterministic ID above), but each caller only knows about the one record it
currently has in hand — a plain payload overwrite would leave the point
remembering only the last writer's single group/connector instead of the
union across all of them. See ``_merge_membership`` and the per-entity lock
in ``_entity_lock``.

That lock is keyed by ``(event loop, entity)``, so it serialises writers only
within one loop of one process. It does not cover the two cases that occur in
practice: indexing runs some work on the main loop and some on a worker-thread
loop, which take different locks for the same entity, and separate indexing
workers hold separate instances entirely. Either pair can merge against the
same stale read and drop one another's membership; the loser is restored when
the affected record is next reindexed. Closing that needs a distributed lock
or a backend compare-and-set, neither of which exists here yet.

        put the best candidate first. Hybrid dense + BM25 with RRF is used
        for that, since lexical near-variants are the common case.

        Returns one entry per input name, ``None`` when the name is blank or
        no point of that type/level exists yet. Raises on a vector DB
        failure so the caller can count it and fall back.
