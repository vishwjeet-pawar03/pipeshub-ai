"""SourceCatalog — the single source of truth for knowledge-source rendering.

Every connector ID appears in exactly one place: `SourceCatalog.render()`.
All other prompt sections that formerly re-listed sources use this module.

Finding H (plan): there are two prompt shapes.
  - Agent route (`/agent/{id}/chat/stream`): `agent_knowledge` is populated,
    IDs are actionable → `ids_actionable=True`.
  - Chat route (`/chat/stream`): `agent_knowledge` is empty, only
    `available_connectors` (type names only, no UUIDs) is present →
    `ids_actionable=False`.

Callers use `from_state(state)` which detects the shape automatically.
