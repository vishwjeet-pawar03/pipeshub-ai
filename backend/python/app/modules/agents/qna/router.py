"""Shared building blocks for classifying a user request into PipesHub's
three execution tiers (`quick` / `react` / `deep`): the capability-context
prompt block, the tier rubric, the SQL-toolset override, and prior-turn
message construction.

Originally extracted from `app/api/routes/agent.py::_auto_select_graph`
(Phase 7 of the agent-loop migration) alongside a standalone `classify_route()`
call site. `classify_route()` itself has since been removed — the agent-loop
adapter's `app.agents.agent_loop.intent.parse_intent_and_route()` now performs
the actual tier classification (`include_routing=True`) as ONE LLM call that
also does intent/query rewriting, reusing these same building blocks so the
tier definitions never drift between the two concerns. This module now stops
at the shared prompt pieces — the classification call itself lives in
`intent.py`.
