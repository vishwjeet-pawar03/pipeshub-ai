        The fallback path, for connectors whose points predate the membership
        arrays — a graph lookup per VRID is the only way to reach a point that
        carries no ``connectorIds`` to find itself by. :meth:`purge_connector`
        is the normal path and needs no list.

        ``DROP_COLLECTION`` reaches here only when the registry has *proven*
        ``ctx.is_last_writer_to_collection`` — it downgrades an unproven drop
        to a filtered delete rather than trusting the strategy — so nothing
        can still be sharing a point through deduplication. Not reachable
        under ``SingleCollectionStrategy``.

        ``FILTERED_DELETE`` is different: this connector's collection can
        still hold points deduplicated with a still-live connector (same
        ``virtualRecordId`` shared via the dedup matrix). A raw filter-delete
        on ``connectorIds`` would remove those shared points too, so this

        membership instead of deleting when a VRID is still referenced
        elsewhere. When the producer sent no VRID list — an older publisher, or
        a genuinely enumeration-free purge — the ids are recovered by scanning
        the target collections rather than falling back to the unsafe raw
        filter, which is the one path that could take a live connector's shared
