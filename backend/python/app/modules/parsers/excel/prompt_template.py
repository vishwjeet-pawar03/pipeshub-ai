# Task:
You are a data analysis expert tasked with identifying and validating table headers in an Excel document. Your goal is to ensure each table has appropriate, descriptive headers that accurately represent the data columns.

# Input:
You will be given:
1. The current table being analyzed
2. Context of all tables in the sheet for reference
3. The table's position and metadata

# Analysis Guidelines:
1. Header Detection:
   - First, analyze if the first row contains valid headers
   - Check if headers are descriptive and meaningful
   - Verify headers match the data type and content below them
   - Ensure headers are unique within the table

2. Header Creation (if needed):
   - If headers are missing or inadequate, create appropriate ones
   - Base new headers on:
     * Column data content and patterns
     * Context from surrounding tables
     * Common business terminology
     * Standard naming conventions

3. Header Validation:
   - Ensure each header is:
     * Clear and concise
     * Descriptive of the column content
     * Professional and consistent in style
     * Free of special characters or spaces
     * Unique within the table

# Current Table:
{table_data}

# Context (Other Tables in Sheet):

{rows_text}

Determine:
1. Does this table have headers? (true/false)
2. If yes, how many rows do the headers span? (1, 2, 3, or more)

CRITICAL RULE for header detection:
- A row is a header row ONLY if ALL non-empty cells contain header-like values (category descriptors)
- If even ONE cell contains a data value (specific measurement, number, amount, identifier), the ENTIRE row is NOT a header
- You MUST check EVERY non-empty cell - do not stop after checking the first cell
- Empty cells can be ignored

COMMON MISTAKE to avoid:
- Row where first cell looks like a label but remaining cells are numeric values
- Example: ["Gross AOV", "$55.89", "$53.33", ...]
- This is NOT a header row - it's a DATA row with a row label in the first column
- The values $55.89, $53.33 are specific measurements, not category descriptors

CORE PRINCIPLE - Understanding Headers vs Data:

HEADER-LIKE values describe CATEGORIES or TYPES:
- They answer: "What TYPE/CATEGORY of information is in this column?"
- They are DESCRIPTIVE LABELS that remain constant across rows
- Examples: "Name", "Age", "Department", "Q1_Sales", "Region", "Month"
- Think: Would this value describe what kind of data belongs here?

DATA values are SPECIFIC INSTANCES or MEASUREMENTS:
- They answer: "What is the SPECIFIC VALUE for this entry?"
- They are ACTUAL MEASUREMENTS, OBSERVATIONS, or IDENTIFIERS
- They vary from row to row (not constant labels)
- Examples: "John Smith", 35, $55.89, 0.95, "jan-2024", "North", "ABC-123"
- Think: Is this a specific number, amount, measurement, name, or identifier?

KEY INSIGHT - Numbers and Measurements:
- ANY specific numeric value, regardless of format, is DATA
  * Plain numbers: 42, 1250.50, 0.95
  * Currency: $55.89, €100, £75, ¥1000 (any currency symbol + number)
  * Percentages: 95.5%, 42%, 0.93 (when representing a specific value)
  * Dates: 2024-01-15, Jan-2024, 15-Jan
- Numeric labels that describe columns could be headers: "Q1", "Q2", "2024", "Month1"
  (But these must appear with OTHER header-like values, not mixed with data)

Examples:

Example 1 - Valid single-row header:
Row 1: ["Name", "Age", "Department", "Salary"]
Row 2: ["John Smith", 35, "Sales", 75000]
→ Row 1 is a header (all cells are descriptive labels)
→ has_headers: true, num_header_rows: 1

Example 2 - Invalid header (contains data):
Row 1: ["Name", "John Smith", "Age", 35]
Row 2: ["Department", "Sales", "Salary", 75000]
→ Row 1 is NOT a header (contains data values: "John Smith" and 35)
→ Row 2 is NOT a header (contains data values: "Sales" as a specific value and 75000)
→ has_headers: false, num_header_rows: 0

Example 3 - Valid multi-row header:
Row 1: ["Sales", "Sales", "Expenses", "Expenses"]
Row 2: ["Q1", "Q2", "Q1", "Q2"]
Row 3: [1250, 1430, 890, 920]
→ Rows 1 and 2 are headers (all non-empty cells are descriptive labels)
→ Row 3 is data (contains numbers)
→ has_headers: true, num_header_rows: 2

Example 4 - Invalid header (row labels + data values):
Row 1: ["Gross AOV", "$55.89", "$53.33", "$58.22", "$55.44"]
Row 2: ["Net AOV", "$73.28", "$74.65", "$74.00", "$75.36"]
Row 3: ["New", 0.98, 0.95, 0.95, 0.93]
Row 4: ["Repeat", 0.93, 0.94, 0.94, 0.93]
→ Analysis: Row 1 has "Gross AOV" (descriptive) but $55.89, $53.33, etc. are SPECIFIC currency amounts (data)
→ All rows follow pattern: descriptive label in col 1, specific numeric values in cols 2+
→ This table has ROW LABELS in first column, not column headers in first row
→ has_headers: false, num_header_rows: 0

Consider:
- Single-row headers: One row with descriptive column names (ALL cells must be header-like)
- Multi-row headers: Headers spanning multiple rows (e.g., grouped categories in row 1, subcategories in row 2). Each header row must have ALL cells as header-like values
- No headers: All rows appear to be data, or any potential header row contains at least one data value

Excel-specific patterns to consider:
- Merged cells often indicate multi-row headers
- Bold/styled first rows often indicate headers
- Text in first row(s) + numbers/data in subsequent rows suggests headers
- BUT: Always apply the CRITICAL RULE - ALL non-empty cells must be header-like
