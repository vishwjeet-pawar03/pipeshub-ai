"""
Layout region extraction from a pdfplumber Page.

Handles single-column and two-column page layouts. When the page is
detected to have two columns, line-grouping, block-segmentation, and
reading order all become column-aware so that:

  * Words on opposite sides of the gutter are never merged into one
    line (unless they form a genuine full-width run with uniform spacing,
    e.g. a heading).
  * A wide heading/table/figure cannot swallow column blocks via the
    open-blocks attachment heuristic.
  * Reading order is left column top-to-bottom, then right column,
    with full-width elements interleaved at their y position.

Single-column pages take exactly the same path as before -- the new
machinery is gated on a `gutter_x` that is `None` unless column
detection actually finds two columns.

    Returns a :class:`ColumnDetectionResult`. When the page is judged
    single-column, ``gutter_x`` is ``None``; otherwise it carries the
    x-coordinate of the gutter midpoint.

    ``table_bboxes`` (optional): bboxes of regions already known to be
    tables. Lines whose words lie mostly inside one of these bboxes are
    excluded from voting -- their gap pattern is driven by table column
    structure, not page column flow. Critically, this only suppresses
    rows of tables that upstream detection actually found. Rows of
    *undetected* tables are filtered by an independent
    in-function heuristic (see ``_is_tabular_row`` below).

    ``raster_getter`` (optional): a zero-arg callable returning
    ``(img_rgb, scale_px_per_pt)``. When provided, a candidate that
    would otherwise be hard-rejected at the ``voting_word_fraction``
    or ``confidence`` gate may be rescued if a vertical ink-projection
    profile shows a clear valley at the candidate gutter. Rescue is
    capped by ``_COL_RESCUE_MIN_CONFIDENCE`` so it never rescues
    candidates the text-side already considered weak. When omitted
    behavior is identical to the pre-rescue version.

    The detector defends against three classes of false positive:

    1. *Undetected table rows* -- caught by self-detecting tabular
       lines (3+ significant internal gaps) and by the y-distribution
       check on peak supporters (table rows cluster in a narrow band).
    2. *Sidebars and narrow note columns* -- caught by the
       side-population balance check.
    3. *Chance central-gap alignment on single-column pages* -- caught
       by a higher floor on peak voter count and peak/spanner ratio,
       plus the y-distribution and balance checks above.

# Striped-fill frame detection
#
# Some code-block environments (e.g. LaTeX ``listings`` framed/coloured
# variants) draw their background as a stack of thin filled rectangles
# -- one strip per text line -- rather than as a single fill. That
# rendering pattern mimics a fully-ruled table at the vector level and
# causes both ``page.find_tables()`` and ``_detect_table_boxes_from_vectors``
# to emit false-positive TABLE candidates spanning the entire code
# block.
#
# The helpers below identify such striped-fill regions so the table
# detector can skip candidates that lie inside one. Three independent
# defenses are stacked to keep this from regressing on genuine banded
# data tables:
#
#   1. Structural -- a stripe cluster requires multiple fill rects with
#      matching x-extents, matching color, and edge-to-edge vertical
#      tiling. Zebra-striped rows fail this because they alternate fill
#      with white. Small callouts fail the count threshold.
#   2. Structural -- the cluster bbox must contain no internal column
#      rules or interior horizontal rules. Bordered/ruled tables with
#      coloured rows fail this gate.
#   3. Semantic -- the chars inside the cluster must be predominantly
#      monospace, by font-name match or width-uniformity. Data tables
#      using a proportional font fail this gate.
#
# A real banded data table would have to fail all three gates
# simultaneously to be wrongly suppressed.
