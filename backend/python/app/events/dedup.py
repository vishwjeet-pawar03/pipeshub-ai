"""Which MD5 duplicate decides a record's fate, and what that decision is.

Two records with identical content are duplicates of each other for *blob*
purposes always — the parsed content is stored once and reused. Whether they
are duplicates for *indexing* purposes depends on the collection strategy: a
record whose twin already has vectors in the collection this record would write
to needs no work, but a twin in a different collection has left nothing behind
here, so this record must still be indexed.

Under ``single`` every record resolves to one collection and this degenerates
to "any duplicate means skip". Under ``per_connector_type`` it means the skip
and queue decisions apply **within a connector type only** — a Slack copy of a
file cannot stand in for the Drive collection's missing vectors.

Kept apart from ``events.py`` because it is a pure policy over graph documents:
no I/O, no EventProcessor, and every branch of the matrix is worth testing
directly.

    never be repaired.
