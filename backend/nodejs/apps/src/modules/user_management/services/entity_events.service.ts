   * This used to publish directly and swallow broker failures, which meant a
   * caller could write a user, fail to tell the permission graph, and report
   * success — leaving someone who could sign in but see nothing, with nothing
   * explaining why. Writing it down instead makes delivery late rather than
   * lost.
   *
   * Pass the `session` of the transaction that made the change, where the
   * caller has one. The event is then stored by the same commit that stored
   * the change, so the two cannot disagree. Without a session the write still
   * happens, just not atomically: the remaining gap is the microseconds
   * between two database writes, rather than the length of a broker outage.
   *
   * Unlike the old version this throws. Failing to write to the database is
   * not a broker hiccup to be logged past; it means the caller's own operation
   * has not fully happened, and the caller should hear about it.
