# Roll a PipesHub deployment back to a previous image tag.
# ==============================================================================
# Shipping daily is safe when a bad release is cheap to undo, not when every
# release is perfect. This is the undo, and it is deliberately boring: it moves
# IMAGE_TAG in .env and re-runs the installer's upgrade path, which is the same
# code path a forward upgrade uses and is therefore already exercised.
#
#   ./rollback.sh                 # back to the previously recorded tag
#   ./rollback.sh 0.6.0           # back to a specific version
#   ./rollback.sh --list          # what this deployment has run
#   ./rollback.sh --dry-run 0.6.0 # print what would happen
#
# What it does NOT do: restore data. A rollback undoes code, not migrations. If
# the release you are undoing migrated data irreversibly, restore from backup
# instead — this script tells you when that risk applies rather than pretending
# it does not exist.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  Rolling back changes the code, not the data. If ${CURRENT} ran a
  migration that rewrote existing records, the older image may not
  understand them, and the correct recovery is restoring a backup
  rather than rolling back.

  Safe to roll back:  a bug in request handling, UI, or a connector
  Restore instead:    anything that changed stored data on upgrade
